abstract	= {Understanding the theoretical foundations of how memories
		  are encoded and retrieved in neural populations is a
		  central challenge in neuroscience. A popular theoretical
		  scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor
		  neural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield
		  model. The model simplicity and the locality of the
		  synaptic update rules come at the cost of a poor storage
		  capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with
		  perceptron learning algorithms. Here, by transforming the
		  perceptron learning rule, we present an online learning
		  rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves
		  near-maximal storage capacity without an explicit
		  supervisory error signal, relying only upon locally
		  accessible information. The fully-connected network
		  consists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic
		  recurrent connections and non-plastic inhibitory feedback
		  stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory patterns to be
		  memorized are presented online as strong afferent currents,
		  producing a bimodal distribution for the neuron synaptic
		  inputs. Synapses corresponding to active inputs are
		  modified as a function of the value of the local fields
		  with respect to three thresholds. Above the highest
		  threshold, and below the lowest threshold, no plasticity
		  occurs. In between these two thresholds,
		  potentiation/depression occurs when the local field is
		  above/below an intermediate threshold. We simulated and
		  analyzed a network of binary neurons implementing this rule
		  and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of
		  the basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained
		  through numerical simulations is shown to be close to the
		  value predicted by analytical calculations. We also
		  measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of
		  external inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of
		  the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix, and found that
		  both the fraction of zero weight synapses and the degree of
		  symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the number of
		  stored patterns.},

abstract	= {The brain uses spikes in neural circuits to perform many
		  dynamical computations. The computations are performed with
		  properties such as spiking efficiency, i.e. minimal number
		  of spikes, and robustness to noise. A major obstacle for
		  learning computations in artificial spiking neural networks
		  with such desired biological properties is due to lack of
		  our understanding of how biological spiking neural networks
		  learn computations. Here, we consider the credit assignment
		  problem, i.e. determining the local contribution of each
		  synapse to the network's global output error, for learning
		  nonlinear dynamical computations in a spiking network with
		  the desired properties of biological networks. We approach
		  this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced
		  neural networks (EBN) with nonlinear adaptive control
		  theory to propose a local learning rule. Locality of
		  learning rules are ensured by feeding back into the network
		  its own error, resulting in a learning rule depending
		  solely on presynaptic inputs and error feedbacks. The
		  spiking efficiency and robustness of the network are
		  guaranteed by maintaining a tight excitatory/inhibitory
		  balance, ensuring that each spike represents a local
		  projection of the global output error and minimizes a loss
		  function. The resulting networks can learn to implement
		  complex dynamics with very small numbers of neurons and
		  spikes, exhibit the same spike train variability as
		  observed experimentally, and are extremely robust to noise
		  and neuronal loss.},

abstract	= {Neural-network training can be slow and energy intensive,
		  owing to the need to transfer the weight data for the
		  network between conventional digital memory chips and
		  processor chips. Analogue non-volatile memory can
		  accelerate the neural-network training algorithm known as
		  backpropagation by performing parallelized
		  multiply--accumulate operations in the analogue domain at
		  the location of the weight data. However, the
		  classification accuracies of such in situ training using
		  non-volatile-memory hardware have generally been less than
		  those of software-based training, owing to insufficient
		  dynamic range and excessive weight-update asymmetry. Here
		  we demonstrate mixed hardware--software neural-network
		  implementations that involve up to 204,900 synapses and
		  that combine long-term storage in phase-change memory,
		  near-linear updates of volatile capacitors and weight-data
		  transfer with ``polarity inversion'' to cancel out inherent
		  device-to-device variations. We achieve generalization
		  accuracies (on previously unseen data) equivalent to those
		  of software-based training on various commonly used
		  machine-learning test datasets (MNIST, MNIST-backrand,
		  CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). The computational energy
		  efficiency of 28,065 billion operations per second per watt
		  and throughput per area of 3.6 trillion operations per
		  second per square millimetre that we calculate for our
		  implementation exceed those of today's graphical processing
		  units by two orders of magnitude. This work provides a path
		  towards hardware accelerators that are both fast and energy
		  efficient, particularly on fully connected neural-network
		  layers.}

		  frames, arrays, or any other such data-structures are used.
		  This is the first time that an end-to-end stereo pipeline
		  from image acquisition and rectification, multi-scale
		  spatio-temporal stereo correspondence, winner-take-all, to
		  disparity regularization is implemented fully on
		  event-based hardware. Using a cluster of TrueNorth
		  neurosynaptic processors , we demonstrate their ability to
		  process bilateral event-based inputs streamed live by
		  Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), at up to 2,000 disparity maps
		  per second, producing high fidelity disparities which are
		  in turn used to reconstruct , at low power, the depth of
		  events produced from rapidly changing scenes. Experiments
		  on real-world sequences demonstrate the ability of the
		  system to take full advantage of the asynchronous and
		  sparse nature of DVS sensors for low power depth
		  reconstruction, in environments where conventional
		  frame-based cameras connected to synchronous processors
		  would be inefficient for rapidly moving objects. System
		  evaluation on event-based sequences demonstrates a ~ 200 x
		  improvement in terms of power per pixel per disparity map
		  compared to the closest state-of-the-art, and maximum
		  latencies of up to 11ms from spike injection to disparity
		  map ejection.}

abstract	= {For primary auditory cortex (AI) laminae, there is little
		  evidence of functional specificity despite clearly
		  expressed cellular and connectional differences. Natural
		  sounds are dominated by dynamic temporal and spectral
		  modulations and we used these properties to evaluate local
		  functional differences or constancies across laminae. To
		  examine the layer-specific processing of acoustic
		  modulation information, we simultaneously recorded from
		  multiple AI laminae in the anesthetized cat. Neurons were
		  challenged with dynamic moving ripple stimuli and we
		  subsequently computed spectrotemporal receptive fields
		  (STRFs). From the STRFs, temporal and spectral modulation
		  transfer functions (tMTFs, sMTFs) were calculated and
		  compared across layers. Temporal and spectral modulation
		  properties often differed between layers. On average, layer
		  II/III and VI neurons responded to lower temporal
		  modulations than those in layer IV. tMTFs were mainly
		  band-pass in granular layer IV and became more low-pass in
		  infragranular layers. Compared with layer IV, spectral MTFs
		  were broader and their upper cutoff frequencies higher in
		  layers V and VI. In individual penetrations, temporal
		  modulation preference was similar across layers for roughly
		  70\% of the penetrations, suggesting a common, columnar
		  functional characteristic. By contrast, only about 30\% of
		  penetrations showed consistent spectral modulation
		  preferences across layers, indicative of functional laminar
		  diversity or specialization. Since local laminar
		  differences in stimulus preference do not always parallel
		  the main flow of information in the columnar cortical
		  microcircuit, this indicates the influence of additional
		  horizontal or thalamocortical inputs. AI layers that
		  express differing modulation properties may serve distinct
		  roles in the extraction of dynamic sound information, with
		  the differing information specific to the targeted stations
		  of each layer.},

		  twitter calls, contain frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. To
		  determine how this prominent vocalization element is
		  represented in the auditory cortex we examined neural
		  responses to logarithmic FM sweep stimuli in the primary
		  auditory cortex (AI) of two awake owl monkeys. Using an
		  implanted array of microelectrodes we quantitatively
		  characterized neuronal responses to FM sweeps and to random
		  tone-pip stimuli. Tone-pip responses were used to construct
		  spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). Classification of
		  FM sweep responses revealed few neurons with high direction
		  and speed selectivity. Most neurons responded to sweeps in
		  both directions and over a broad range of sweep speeds.
		  Characteristic frequency estimates from FM responses were
		  highly correlated with estimates from STRFs, although
		  spectral receptive field bandwidth was consistently
		  underestimated by FM stimuli. Predictions of FM direction
		  selectivity and best speed from STRFs were significantly
		  correlated with observed FM responses, although some
		  systematic discrepancies existed. Last, the population
		  distributions of FM responses in the awake owl monkey were
		  similar to, although of longer temporal duration than,
		  those in the anesthetized squirrel monkeys.},

abstract	= {All physical systems must reliably extract information
		  from their noisily and partially observable environment,
		  such as distances to objects. Biology has developed
		  reliable mechanisms to combine multi-modal sensory
		  information into a coherent belief about the underlying
		  environment that caused the percept; a process called
		  sensor fusion. Autonomous technical systems (such as mobile
		  robots) employ compute-intense algorithms for sensor
		  fusion, which hardly work in real-time; yet their results
		  in complex unprepared environments are typically inferior
		  to human performance. Despite the little we know about
		  cortical computing principles for sensor fusion, an obvious
		  difference between biological and technical information
		  processing lies in the way information flows: computer
		  algorithms are typically designed as feed-forward
		  filter-banks, whereas in Cortex we see vastly recurrent
		  connected networks with intertwined information processing,
		  storage, and exchange. In this paper we model such
		  information processing as distributed graphical network, in
		  which independent neural computing nodes obtain and
		  represent sensory information, while processing and
		  exchanging exclusively local data. Given various external
		  sensory stimuli, the network relaxes into the best possible
		  explanation of the underlying cause, subject to the
		  inferred reliability of sensor signals. We implement a
		  simple test-case scenario with a 4 dimensional sensor
		  fusion task on an autonomous mobile robot and demonstrate
		  its performance. We expect to be able to expand this sensor
		  fusion principle to vastly more complex tasks.

abstract	= {Object segmentation from 3D range data is an important
		  topic in mobile robotics. A robot navigating in a dynamic
		  environment needs to be aware of objects that might change
		  or move. A segmentation of the laser scans into individual
		  objects is typically the first processing step before a
		  further analysis is performed. In this paper, we present a
		  fast method that segments 3D range data into different
		  objects, runs online, and has small computational demands.
		  Our approach avoids the explicit computation of the 3D
		  point cloud and performs all computations directly on a 2D
		  range image, which enables a fast segmentation for each
		  scan. A further relevant aspect of our method is that we
		  can segment objects even if the 3D data is sparse. This is
		  important for scanners such as the new Velodyne Puck. We
		  implemented our approach in C++ and ROS and thoroughly
		  tested it using different 3D scanners. Our method can
		  operate at over 100 Hz for the 64-beam Velodyne scanner on
		  a single core of a mobile CPU while producing high quality
		  segmentation results. In addition to this, we make the
		  source code for the approach available.},

abstract	= {As the disparity gradient of a stimulus increases, human
		  observers" ability to solve the correspondence problem and
		  thereby estimate the disparities becomes poorer. It finally
		  fails altogether when a critical gradient - the
		  disparity-gradient limit (Burt \& Julesz, 1980)- is
		  reached. We investigated the cause of the
		  disparity-gradient limit. As part of this work, we
		  developed a local cross-correlator similar to ones proposed
		  in the computer vision literature and similar to the
		  disparity-energy model of neurons in area V1. Like humans,
		  the cross-correlator exhibits poorer performance as the
		  disparity gradient increases. We also conducted a
		  psychophysical experiment in which observers were presented
		  sawtooth waveforms defined by disparity. They made spatial
		  phase discriminations. We presented different corrugation
		  spatial frequencies and amplitudes, and measured observers"
		  ability to discriminate the two phases. Coherence
		  thresholds (the proportion of signal dots at threshold
		  relative to the total number of dots in the stimulus) were
		  well predicted by the disparity gradient and not by either
		  the spatial frequency or amplitude of the corrugation
		  waveform. Thus, human observers and a local
		  cross-correlator exhibit similar behavior, which suggests
		  that humans use such an algorithm to estimate disparity. As
		  a consequence, disparity estimation is done with local
		  estimates of constant disparity (piecewise frontal), which
		  places a constraint on the highest possible stereo
		  resolution.}

		  primary visual cortex. 2. It was found that a stimulus
		  located correctly in the visual fields of both eyes was
		  more effective in driving the units than a monocular
		  stimulus, and much more effective than a binocular stimulus
		  which was correctly positioned in only one eye: the
		  response to the correctly located image in one eye is
		  vetoed if the image is incorrectly located in the other
		  eye. 3. The vertical and horizontal disparities of the
		  paired retinal images that yielded the maximum response
		  were measured in 87 units from seven cats: the range of
		  horizontal disparities was 6.6$^\circ$, of vertical
		  disparities 2.2$^\circ$. 4. With fixed convergence,
		  different units will be optimally excited by objects lying
		  at different distances. This may be the basic mechanism
		  underlying depth discrimination in the cat.}

abstract	= {How are firing rates in a spiking network related to

		  important problem because firing rates are a key measure of
		  network activity, in both the study of neural computation
		  and neural network dynamics. However, it is a difficult
		  problem, because the spiking mechanism of individual
		  neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons
		  interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new
		  technique for calculating firing rates in optimal balanced
		  networks. These are particularly interesting networks
		  because they provide an optimal spike-based signal
		  representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity
		  through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We
		  can calculate firing rates by treating balanced network
		  dynamics as an algorithm for optimising signal
		  representation. We identify this algorithm and then
		  calculate firing rates by finding the solution to the
		  algorithm. Our firing rate calculation relates network
		  firing rates directly to network input, connectivity and

abstract	= {We first propose an ultra-compact energy-efficient
		  time-domain vector-by-matrix multiplier (VMM) based on a
		  commercial 3D-NAND flash memory structure. The proposed
		  3D-VMM uses a novel resistive successive integrate and
		  re-scaling (RSIR) scheme to eliminate the stringent
		  requirement of a bulky load capacitor which otherwise
		  dominates the area- and energy-landscape of the
		  conventional time-domain VMMs. Our rigorous analysis,
		  performed at the 55-nm technology node, shows that
		  RSIR-3D-VMM achieves a record-breaking area efficiency of
		  ~0.02 $\mu$m2/Byte and the energy efficiency of ~6 fJ/Op
		  for a 500x500 4-bit VMM, representing 5x and 1.3x
		  improvements over the previously reported 3D-VMM approach.
		  Moreover, unlike the previous approach, the proposed VMM
		  can be efficiently tailored to work in a smaller current
		  output range. Our second major contribution is the
		  development of 3D-aCortex, a multi-purpose neuromorphic
		  inference processor that utilizes the proposed 3D-VMM block
		  as its core processing unit. Rigorous performance modeling
		  of the 3D-aCortex targeting several state-of-the-art neural
		  network benchmarks has shown that it may provide a
		  record-breaking 30.7 MB/mm2storage efficiency, 113.3 TOp/J
		  peak energy efficiency, and 10.66 TOp/s computational
		  throughput. The system-level analysis indicates that the
		  gain in the area efficiency of RSIR leads to a smaller data
		  transfer delay, which compensates for the reduction in the
		  VMM throughput due to an increased input time window.}

abstract	= {Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect subthreshold
		  integrative processes that complement spike train measures.
		  However, little is yet known about the differences between
		  how LFPs and spikes encode rich naturalistic sensory
		  stimuli. We addressed this question by recording LFPs and
		  spikes from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized
		  macaques while presenting a color movie. We then determined
		  how the power of LFPs and spikes at different frequencies
		  represents the visual features in the movie. We found that
		  the most informative LFP frequency ranges were 1-8 and
		  60-100 Hz. LFPs in the range of 12-40 Hz carried little
		  information about the stimulus, and may primarily reflect
		  neuromodulatory inputs. Spike power was informative only at
		  frequencies <12 Hz. We further quantified "signal
		  correlations" (correlations in the trial-averaged power
		  response to different stimuli) and "noise correlations"
		  (trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuations around the
		  average) of LFPs and spikes recorded from the same
		  electrode. We found positive signal correlation between
		  high-gamma LFPs (60-100 Hz) and spikes, as well as strong
		  positive signal correlation within high-gamma LFPs,
		  suggesting that high-gamma LFPs and spikes are generated
		  within the same network. LFPs <24 Hz shared strong positive
		  noise correlations, indicating that they are influenced by
		  a common source, such as a diffuse neuromodulatory input.
		  LFPs <40 Hz showed very little signal and noise
		  correlations with LFPs >40 Hz and with spikes, suggesting
		  that low-frequency LFPs reflect neural processes that in
		  natural conditions are fully decoupled from those giving
		  rise to spikes and to high-gamma LFPs.}

		  human stereopsis, binocular rivalry and binocular contrast
		  summation, with discussion where relevant of single-unit
		  neurophysiology and human brain imaging. We identify
		  several key controversies that have stimulated important
		  work on these problems. In the case of stereopsis those
		  controversies include position vs. phase encoding of
		  disparity, dependence of disparity limits on spatial scale,
		  role of occlusion in binocular depth and surface
		  perception, and motion in 3D. In the case of binocular
		  rivalry, controversies include eye vs. stimulus rivalry,
		  role of "top-down" influences on rivalry dynamics, and the
		  interaction of binocular rivalry and stereopsis. Concerning
		  binocular contrast summation, the essay focuses on two
		  representative models that highlight the evolving
		  complexity in this field of study.}

abstract	= {Most of our daily actions are subject to uncertainty.
		  Behavioral studies have confirmed that humans handle this
		  uncertainty in a statistically optimal manner. A key
		  question then is what neural mechanisms underlie this
		  optimality, i.e. how can neurons represent and compute with
		  probability distributions. Previous approaches have
		  proposed that probabilities are encoded in the firing rates
		  of neural populations. However, such rate codes appear
		  poorly suited to understand perception in a constantly
		  changing environment. In particular, it is unclear how
		  probabilistic computations could be implemented by
		  biologically plausible spiking neurons. Here, we propose a
		  network of spiking neurons that can optimally combine
		  uncertain information from different sensory modalities and
		  keep this information available for a long time. This
		  implies that neural memories not only represent the most
		  likely value of a stimulus but rather a whole probability
		  distribution over it. Furthermore, our model suggests that
		  each spike conveys new, essential information.
		  Consequently, the observed variability of neural responses
		  cannot simply be understood as noise but rather as a
		  necessary consequence of optimal sensory integration. Our
		  results therefore question strongly held beliefs about the
		  nature of neural 'signal' and 'noise'. }

abstract	= {Two observations about the cortex have puzzled
		  neuroscientists for a long time. First, neural responses
		  are highly variable. Second, the level of excitation and
		  inhibition received by each neuron is tightly balanced at
		  all times. Here, we demonstrate that both properties are
		  necessary consequences of neural networks that represent
		  information efficiently in their spikes. We illustrate this
		  insight with spiking networks that represent dynamical
		  variables. Our approach is based on two assumptions: We
		  assume that information about dynamical variables can be
		  read out linearly from neural spike trains, and we assume
		  that neurons only fire a spike if that improves the
		  representation of the dynamical variables. Based on these
		  assumptions, we derive a network of leaky
		  integrate-and-fire neurons that is able to implement
		  arbitrary linear dynamical systems. We show that the
		  membrane voltage of the neurons is equivalent to a
		  prediction error about a common population-level signal.
		  Among other things, our approach allows us to construct an
		  integrator network of spiking neurons that is robust
		  against many perturbations. Most importantly, neural
		  variability in our networks cannot be equated to noise.
		  Despite exhibiting the same single unit properties as
		  widely used population code models (e.g. tuning curves,
		  Poisson distributed spike trains), balanced networks are
		  orders of magnitudes more reliable. Our approach suggests
		  that spikes do matter when considering how the brain
		  computes, and that the reliability of cortical
		  representations could have been strongly underestimated.

abstract	= {Bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) establish a
		  two-way direct communication link 4 between the brain and
		  the external world. A decoder translates recorded neural
		  activity into motor 5 commands and an encoder delivers
		  sensory information collected from the environment directly
		  6 to the brain creating a closed-loop system. These two
		  modules are typically integrated in bulky 7 external
		  devices. However, the clinical support of patients with
		  severe motor and sensory deficits 8 requires compact,
		  low-power, and fully implantable systems that can decode
		  neural signals to 9 control external devices. As a first
		  step toward this goal, we developed a modular bidirectional
		  BMI 10 setup that uses a compact neuromorphic processor as
		  a decoder. On this chip we implemented 11 a network of
		  spiking neurons built using its ultra-low-power
		  mixed-signal analog/digital circuits. 12 On-chip on-line
		  spike-timing-dependent plasticity synapse circuits enabled
		  the network to learn 13 to decode neural signals recorded
		  from the brain into motor outputs controlling the movements
		  14 of an external device. The modularity of the BMI allowed
		  us to tune the individual components 15 of the setup
		  without modifying the whole system. In this paper we
		  present the features of 16 this modular BMI, and describe
		  how we configured the network of spiking neuron circuits to
		  17 implement the decoder and to coordinate it with the
		  encoder in an experimental BMI paradigm 18 that connects
		  bidirectionally the brain of an anesthetized rat with an
		  external object. We show that 19 the chip learned the
		  decoding task correctly, allowing the interfaced brain to
		  control the object's 20 trajectories robustly. Based on our
		  demonstration, we propose that neuromorphic technology is
		  21 mature enough for the development of BMI modules that
		  are sufficiently low-power and compact, 22 while being
		  highly computationally powerful and adaptive.}

		  synchronize the E-cells, and the E-cells drive and
		  synchronize the I-cells. We refer to rhythms generated in
		  this way as PING (pyramidal-interneuronal gamma) rhythms.
		  The PING mechanism requires that the drive II to the
		  I-cells be sufficiently low; the rhythm is lost when II
		  gets too large. This can happen in at least two ways. In
		  the first mechanism, the I-cells spike in synchrony, but
		  get ahead of the E-cells, spiking without being prompted by
		  the E-cells. We call this phase walkthrough of the I-cells.
		  In the second mechanism, the I-cells fail to synchronize,
		  and their activity leads to complete suppression of the
		  E-cells. Noisy spiking in the E-cells, generated by noisy
		  external drive, adds excitatory drive to the I-cells and
		  may lead to phase walkthrough. Noisy spiking in the I-cells
		  adds inhibition to the E-cells and may lead to suppression
		  of the E-cells. An analysis of the conditions under which
		  noise leads to phase walkthrough of the I-cells or
		  suppression of the E-cells shows that PING rhythms at
		  frequencies far below the gamma range are robust to noise
		  only if network parameter values are tuned very carefully.
		  Together with an argument explaining why the PING mechanism
		  does not work far above the gamma range in the presence of
		  heterogeneity, this justifies the "G" in "PING.".},

abstract	= {Information about time-dependent sensory stimuli is
		  encoded in the activity of neural populations; distinct
		  aspects of the stimulus are read out by different types of
		  neurons: while overall information is perceived by
		  integrator cells, so-called coincidence detector cells are
		  driven mainly by the synchronous activity in the population
		  that encodes predominantly high-frequency content of the
		  input signal (high-pass information filtering). Previously,
		  an analytically accessible statistic called the partial
		  synchronous output was introduced as a proxy for the
		  coincidence detector cell's output in order to approximate
		  its information transmission. In the first part of the
		  current paper, we compare the information filtering
		  properties (specifically, the coherence function) of this
		  proxy to those of a simple coincidence detector neuron. We
		  show that the latter's coherence function can indeed be
		  well-approximated by the partial synchronous output with a
		  time scale and threshold criterion that are related
		  approximately linearly to the membrane time constant and
		  firing threshold of the coincidence detector cell. In the
		  second part of the paper, we propose an alternative theory
		  for the spectral measures (including the coherence) of the
		  coincidence detector cell that combines linear-response
		  theory for shot-noise driven integrate-and-fire neurons
		  with a novel perturbation ansatz for the spectra of
		  spike-trains driven by colored noise. We demonstrate how
		  the variability of the synaptic weights for connections
		  from the population to the coincidence detector can shape
		  the information transmission of the entire two-stage
		  system.},

abstract	= {To predict sensory inputs or control motor trajectories,
		  the brain must constantly learn temporal dynamics based on
		  error feedback. However, it remains unclear how such
		  supervised learning is implemented in biological neural
		  networks. Learning in recurrent spiking networks is
		  notoriously difficult because local changes in connectivity
		  may have an unpredictable effect on the global dynamics.
		  The most commonly used learning rules, such as temporal
		  back-propagation, are not local and thus not biologically
		  plausible. Furthermore, reproducing the Poisson-like
		  statistics of neural responses requires the use of networks
		  with balanced excitation and inhibition. Such balance is
		  easily destroyed during learning. Using a top-down
		  approach, we show how networks of integrate-and-fire
		  neurons can learn arbitrary linear dynamical systems by
		  feeding back their error as a feed-forward input. The
		  network uses two types of recurrent connections: fast and
		  slow. The fast connections learn to balance excitation and
		  inhibition using a voltage-based plasticity rule. The slow
		  connections are trained to minimize the error feedback
		  using a current-based Hebbian learning rule. Importantly,
		  the balance maintained by fast connections is crucial to
		  ensure that global error signals are available locally in
		  each neuron, in turn resulting in a local learning rule for
		  the slow connections. This demonstrates that spiking
		  networks can learn complex dynamics using purely local
		  learning rules, using E/I balance as the key rather than an
		  additional constraint. The resulting network implements a
		  given function within the predictive coding scheme, with
		  minimal dimensions and activity.},

		  network performance. We find that a network of
		  integrate-and-fire neurons undergoing Hebbian plasticity
		  can learn an optimal spike-based representation for a
		  linear decoder. The learning rule acts to minimise the
		  membrane potential magnitude, which can be interpreted as a
		  representation error after learning. In this way, learning
		  reduces the representation error and drives the network
		  into a robust, balanced regime. The network becomes
		  balanced because small representation errors correspond to
		  small membrane potentials, which in turn results from a
		  balance of excitation and inhibition. The representation is
		  robust because neurons become self-correcting, only spiking
		  if the representation error exceeds a threshold.
		  Altogether, these results suggest that several observed
		  features of cortical dynamics, such as
		  excitatory-inhibitory balance, integrate-and-fire dynamics
		  and Hebbian plasticity, are signatures of a robust, optimal

abstract	= {Animals learn to make predictions, such as associating the
		  sound of a bell with upcoming feeding or predicting a
		  movement that a motor command is eliciting. How predictions
		  are realized on the neuronal level and what plasticity rule
		  underlies their learning is not well understood. Here we
		  propose a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule
		  to learn predictions on a single neuron level on a
		  timescale of seconds. The learning rule allows a spiking
		  two-compartment neuron to match its current firing rate to
		  its own expected future discounted firing rate. For
		  instance, if an originally neutral event is repeatedly
		  followed by an event that elevates the firing rate of a
		  neuron, the originally neutral event will eventually also
		  elevate the neuron's firing rate. The plasticity rule is a
		  form of spike timing dependent plasticity in which a
		  presynaptic spike followed by a postsynaptic spike leads to
		  potentiation. Even if the plasticity window has a width of
		  20 milliseconds, associations on the time scale of seconds
		  can be learned. We illustrate prospective coding with three
		  examples: learning to predict a time varying input,
		  learning to predict the next stimulus in a delayed
		  paired-associate task and learning with a recurrent network
		  to reproduce a temporally compressed version of a sequence.
		  We discuss the potential role of the learning mechanism in
		  classical trace conditioning. In the special case that the
		  signal to be predicted encodes reward, the neuron learns to
		  predict the discounted future reward and learning is
		  closely related to the temporal difference learning
		  algorithm TD($\lambda$).},

		  functional meaning emerges from biophysical phenomena. In

		  deemed unreliable and redundant. Here we challenge this
		  view and show that many single-neuron quantities, including
		  voltages, firing thresholds, excitation, inhibition, and
		  spikes, acquire precise functional meaning whenever a
		  network learns to transmit information parsimoniously and
		  precisely to the next layer. Based on the hypothesis that
		  neural circuits generate precise population codes under
		  severe constraints on metabolic costs, we derive synaptic
		  plasticity rules that allow a network to represent its
		  time-varying inputs with maximal accuracy. We provide exact
		  solutions to the learnt optimal states, and we predict the
		  properties of an entire network from its input distribution
		  and the cost of activity. Single-neuron variability and
		  tuning curves as typically observed in cortex emerge over
		  the course of learning, but paradoxically coincide with a
		  precise, non-redundant spike-based population code. Our

abstract	= {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) employing memristive
		  synapses are capable of life-long online learning. Because
		  of their ability to process and classify large amounts of
		  data in real-time using compact and low-power electronic
		  systems, they promise a substantial technology
		  breakthrough. However, the critical issue that
		  memristor-based SNNs have to face is the fundamental
		  limitation in their memory capacity due to finite
		  resolution of the synaptic elements, which leads to the
		  replacement of old memories with new ones and to a finite
		  memory lifetime. In this study we demonstrate that the
		  nonlinear conductance dynamics of memristive devices can be
		  exploited to improve the memory lifetime of a network. The
		  network is simulated on the basis of a spiking neuron model
		  of mixed-signal digital-analogue sub-threshold neuromorphic
		  CMOS circuits, and on memristive synapse models derived
		  from the experimental nonlinear conductance dynamics of
		  resistive memory devices when stimulated by trains of
		  identical pulses. The network learning circuits implement a
		  spike-based plasticity rule compatible with both
		  spike-timing and rate-based learning rules. In order to get
		  an insight on the memory lifetime of the network, we
		  analyse the learning dynamics in the context of a classical
		  benchmark of neural network learning, that is hand-written
		  digit classification. In the proposed architecture, the
		  memory lifetime and the performance of the network are
		  improved for memristive synapses with nonlinear dynamics
		  with respect to linear synapses with similar resolution.
		  These results demonstrate the importance of following
		  holistic approaches that combine the study of theoretical
		  learning models with the development of neuromorphic CMOS
		  SNNs with memristive devices used to implement life-long
		  on-chip learning.}

		  studies have shown that synaptic plasticity allows a

		  we study the properties of the excitatory synaptic
		  connectivity in a network that maximizes the number of
		  stored patterns of activity in a robust fashion. We show
		  that the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix has the
		  following properties: it is sparse, with a large fraction
		  of zero synaptic weights ('potential' synapses);
		  bidirectionally coupled pairs of neurons are
		  over-represented in comparison to a random network; and
		  bidirectionally connected pairs have stronger synapses on

abstract	= {Summary Recent advances in bioelectronics and neural
		  engineering allowed the development of brain machine
		  interfaces and neuroprostheses, capable of facilitating or
		  recovering functionality in people with neurological
		  disability. To realize energy-efficient and real-time
		  capable devices, neuromorphic computing systems are
		  envisaged as the core of next-generation systems for brain
		  repair. We demonstrate here a real-time hardware
		  neuromorphic prosthesis to restore bidirectional
		  interactions between two neuronal populations, even when
		  one is damaged or missing. We used in vitro modular cell
		  cultures to mimic the mutual interaction between neuronal
		  assemblies and created a focal lesion to functionally
		  disconnect the two populations. Then, we employed our
		  neuromorphic prosthesis for bidirectional bridging to
		  artificially reconnect two disconnected neuronal modules
		  and for hybrid bidirectional bridging to replace the
		  activity of one module with a real-time hardware
		  neuromorphic Spiking Neural Network. Our neuroprosthetic
		  system opens avenues for the exploitation of
		  neuromorphic-based devices in bioelectrical therapeutics
		  for health care.}

		  disparities within this limit, known as Panum's fusional
		  area, will appear fused and single, while objects with
		  disparities outside the limit appear double. It is
		  demonstrated, however, that the disparity gradient, rather
		  than the disparity magnitude, dictates binocular fusion
		  when several objects occur near one another in the visual
		  field. The disparity gradient is defined as the difference
		  between the disparities of neighboring objects divided by
		  their angular separation. If this ratio exceeds a critical
		  value ({\textasciitilde}1) then fusion does not occur, even
		  though the absolute disparities of the individual objects
		  may be well within the classical Panum's area. This
		  discovery leads to the reinterpretation of several
		  enigmatic phenomena in stereopsis, including Panum's
		  limiting case.}

abstract	= {Electrophysiological studies in mammal primary auditory
		  cortex have demonstrated neuronal tuning and cortical
		  spatial organization based upon spectral and temporal
		  qualities of the stimulus including: its frequency,
		  intensity, amplitude modulation and frequency modulation.
		  Although communication and other behaviourally relevant
		  sounds are usually complex, most response characterizations
		  have used tonal stimuli. To better understand the
		  mechanisms necessary to process complex sounds, we
		  investigated neuronal responses to a specific class of
		  broadband stimuli, auditory gratings or ripple stimuli, and
		  compared the responses with single tone responses. Ripple
		  stimuli consisted of 150-200 frequency components with the
		  intensity of each component adjusted such that the envelope
		  of the frequency spectrum is sinusoidal. It has been
		  demonstrated that neurons are tuned to specific
		  characteristics of those ripple stimulus including the
		  intensity, the spacing of the peaks, and the location of
		  the peaks and valleys (C. E. Schreiner and B. M. Calhoun,
		  Auditory Neurosci., 1994; 1: 39-61). Although previous
		  results showed that neuronal response strength varied with
		  the intensity and the fundamental frequency of the
		  stimulus, it is shown here that the relative response to
		  different ripple spacings remains essentially constant with
		  changes in the intensity and the fundamental frequency.
		  These findings support a close relationship between
		  pure-tone receptive fields and ripple transfer functions.
		  However, variations of other stimulus characteristics, such
		  as spectral modulation depth, result in non-linear
		  alterations in the ripple transformation. The processing
		  between the basilar membrane and the primary auditory
		  cortex of broadband stimuli appears generally to be
		  non-linear, although specific stimulus qualities, including
		  the phase of the spectral envelope, are processed in a
		  nearly linear manner.},

abstract	= { Donald Hebb's hypothesis that coactivation of neurons
		  leads to the formation of ensembles of neurons has inspired
		  neuroscientists for decades. The experimental creation of
		  such ensembles has been technically challenging. Using
		  two-photon optogenetic stimulation with single-cell
		  resolution, Carrillo-Reid et al. discovered that recurrent
		  activation of a group of neurons creates an ensemble that
		  is imprinted in the brain circuitry. Activation of a single
		  neuron can lead to recall of the entire ensemble in a
		  phenomenon called pattern completion. The artificial
		  ensemble persists over days and can be reactivated at later
		  time points without interfering with endogenous circuitry.
		  Science, this issue p. 691 Hebbian synaptic plasticity can
		  be artificially introduced in the neocortex of awake
		  animals. Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of neurons
		  that may represent building blocks of cortical circuits.
		  These ensembles could be formed by Hebbian plasticity,
		  whereby synapses between coactive neurons are strengthened.
		  Here we report that repetitive activation with two-photon
		  optogenetics of neuronal populations from ensembles in the
		  visual cortex of awake mice builds neuronal ensembles that
		  recur spontaneously after being imprinted and do not
		  disrupt preexisting ones. Moreover, imprinted ensembles can
		  be recalled by single- cell stimulation and remain coactive
		  on consecutive days. Our results demonstrate the persistent
		  reconfiguration of cortical circuits by two-photon
		  optogenetics into neuronal ensembles that can perform
		  pattern completion. }

abstract	= {Emerging non-volatile memory technologies are promising
		  due to their anticipated capacity benefits, non-volatility,
		  and zero idle energy. One of the most promising candidates
		  is resistive random access memory (RRAM) based on resistive
		  switching (RS). This paper reviews the development of RS
		  device technology including the fundamental physics,
		  material engineering, three-dimension (3D) integration, and
		  bottom-up fabrication. The device operation, physical
		  mechanisms for resistive switching, reliability metrics,
		  and memory cell selector candidates are summarized from the
		  recent advancement in both industry and academia. Options
		  for 3D memory array architectures are presented for the
		  mass storage application. Finally, the potential
		  application of bottom-up fabrication approaches for
		  effective manufacturing is introduced.}

		  are being used increasingly in modern authentication
		  systems. These methods are now popular and have found their
		  way into many portable electronics such as smartphones,
		  tablets, and laptops. Furthermore, the use of biometrics
		  enables secure access to private medical data, now
		  collected in wearable devices such as smartwatches. In this
		  work, we present an accurate low-power device
		  authentication system that employs electrocardiogram (ECG)
		  signals as the biometric modality. The proposed ECG
		  processor consists of front-end signal processing of ECG
		  signals and back-end neural networks (NNs) for accurate
		  authentication. The NNs are trained using a cost function
		  that minimizes intra-individual distance over time and
		  maximizes inter-individual distance. Efficient low-power
		  hardware was implemented by using fixed coefficients for
		  ECG signal pre-processing and by using joint optimization
		  of low-precision and structured sparsity for the NNs. We
		  implemented two instances of ECG authentication hardware
		  with 4X and 8X structurally-compressed NNs in 65 nm LP
		  CMOS, which consume low power of 62.37 $\mu$W and 75.41
		  $\mu$W for real-time ECG authentication with a low equal
		  error rate of 1.36{\%} and 1.21{\%}, respectively, for a
		  large 741-subject in-house ECG database. The hardware was
		  evaluated at 10 kHz clock frequency and 1.2 V voltage supply.},

abstract	= {Modern computation based on the von Neumann architecture
		  is today a mature cutting-edge science. In the Von Neumann
		  architecture, processing and memory units are implemented
		  as separate blocks interchanging data intensively and
		  continuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large
		  part of the power consumption. The next generation computer
		  technology is expected to solve problems at the exascale
		  with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these
		  future computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are
		  based on von Neumann type architectures, they will consume
		  between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and will not have
		  intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal
		  with complex data as our brain does. These needs can be
		  addressed by neuromorphic computing systems which are
		  inspired by the biological concepts of the human brain.
		  This new generation of computers has the potential to be
		  used for the storage and processing of large amounts of
		  digital information with much lower power consumption than
		  conventional processors. Among their potential future
		  applications, an important niche is moving the control from
		  data centers to edge devices. The aim of this Roadmap is to
		  present a snapshot of the present state of neuromorphic
		  technology and provide an opinion on the challenges and
		  opportunities that the future holds in the major areas of
		  neuromorphic technology, namely materials, devices,
		  neuromorphic circuits, neuromorphic algorithms,
		  applications, and ethics. The Roadmap is a collection of
		  perspectives where leading researchers in the neuromorphic
		  community provide their own view about the current state
		  and the future challenges for each research area. We hope
		  that this Roadmap will be a useful resource by providing a
		  concise yet comprehensive introduction to readers outside
		  this field, for those who are just entering the field, as
		  well as providing future perspectives for those who are
		  well established in the neuromorphic computing community.}

abstract	= {A reliable and fast sensing of the environment is a
		  fundamental necessity of mobile platforms. Unfortunately
		  conventional cameras due to the current frame-based
		  acquisition paradigm output low temporal dynamics and
		  redundant data flow leading to high computational costs. It
		  is obviously incompatible with the necessities of mobile
		  platforms where energy consumption and computational load
		  are a major issue. The restrictions of the frame-based
		  paradigm are contradictory with applications requiring high
		  speed sensor-based reactive control. This paper introduces
		  a fast obstacle avoidance using the output of an
		  asynchronous event-based time encoded imaging sensor. The
		  approach is event-based in the sense that every incoming
		  event adds to the computation process thus allowing fast
		  avoidance responses. It introduces an event-based
		  time-to-contact approach relying on the computation of
		  visual event-based motion flows. Experiments on a mobile
		  robot are presented in an indoor environment. Time to
		  contact results are compared with those provided by a laser
		  range finder showing that event-based sensing offers new
		  perspectives for mobile robotics sensing.}

abstract	= {We have recently demonstrated the emergence of dynamic
		  feature sensitivity through exposure to formative stimuli
		  in a real-time neuromorphic system implementing a hybrid
		  analog/digital network of spiking neurons. This network,
		  inspired by models of auditory processing in mammals,
		  includes several mutually connected layers with
		  distance-dependent transmission delays and learning in the
		  form of spike timing dependent plasticity, which effects
		  stimulus-driven changes in the network connectivity. Here
		  we present results that demonstrate that the network is
		  robust to a range of variations in the stimulus pattern,
		  such as are found in naturalistic stimuli and neural
		  responses. This robustness is a property critical to the
		  development of realistic, electronic neuromorphic systems.
		  We analyze the variability of the response of the network
		  to "noisy" stimuli which allows us to characterize the
		  acuity in information-theoretic terms. This provides an
		  objective basis for the quantitative comparison of
		  networks, their connectivity patterns, and learning
		  strategies, which can inform future design decisions. We
		  also show, using stimuli derived from speech samples, that
		  the principles are robust to other challenges, such as
		  variable presentation rate, that would have to be met by
		  systems deployed in the real world. Finally we demonstrate
		  the potential applicability of the approach to real sounds.

		  networks (LSTMs), we introduce a recurrent neural network
		  in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that
		  are subtractive (subLSTM). We propose a natural mapping of
		  subLSTMs onto known canonical excitatory-inhibitory
		  cortical microcircuits. Our empirical evaluation across
		  sequential image classification and language modelling
		  tasks shows that subLSTM units can achieve similar
		  performance to LSTM units. These results suggest that
		  cortical circuits can be optimised to solve complex
		  contextual problems and proposes a novel view on their
		  computational function. Overall our work provides a step
		  towards unifying recurrent networks as used in machine
		  learning with their biological counterparts.},

abstract	= {Objective: Low-frequency fiber-tract stimulation has been
		  shown to be effective in treating mesial temporal lobe
		  epilepsies through activation of the hippocampal commissure
		  in rodents and human patients. The corpus callosum is a
		  major pathway connecting the two hemispheres of the brain;
		  however, few experiments have documented corpus callosum
		  stimulation. The objective is to determine the efficacy of
		  corpus callosum stimulation at low frequencies to suppress
		  cortical seizures. Methods: 4-Aminopyridine was injected in
		  the primary motor cortex of 24 rats under anesthesia.
		  Recording electrodes were placed in the contralateral motor
		  cortex and hippocampus. Three pairs of stimulating
		  electrodes were inserted into the corpus callosum along its
		  longitudinal axis. Local field potentials were recorded 1
		  hour before, during, and after stimulation to determine the
		  effect of stimulation on seizure duration. Stimulation was
		  delivered from each pair of electrodes independently in
		  separate experiments. Furthermore, electrical stimulation
		  was applied to the region of the corpus callosum with the
		  highest degree of innervation of the seizure focus to
		  compare the efficacy of different stimulation frequencies
		  (1-30 Hz) on seizure suppression. Results: Corpus callosum
		  stimulation was effective at suppressing seizures at 10 Hz
		  by 76{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05, n = 5) and at 20 Hz by
		  95{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 14). Stimulation at
		  frequencies of 1 and 30 Hz did not have a significant
		  effect on reducing the total time spent seizing (P
		  {\textgreater} 0.9999, n = 5). Furthermore, stimulation was
		  only effective at suppressing seizures when the pair of
		  electrodes was placed within the section of corpus callosum
		  containing fibers innervating the seizure focus.
		  Secondarily generalized seizures in the hippocampus were
		  eliminated when seizures in the cortical focus were
		  suppressed. Significance: Low-frequency fiber-tract
		  stimulation of the corpus callosum suppresses both cortical
		  and cortically induced hippocampal seizures in an acute
		  model of focal cortical seizures. The stimulation paradigm
		  is selective, as it is only effective when targeted to
		  specific regions of the corpus callosum that project
		  maximally to cortical regions generating the seizure
		  activity. Selective placement of stimulation electrodes
		  along the corpus callosum could be used as a
		  patient-specific treatment for cortical epilepsies.},

		  massively parallel information processing abilities, and
		  their high energy efficiency. To achieve these features
		  neuromorphic silicon neuron circuits need to be integrated
		  with plastic synapse circuits capable of on-line learning

		  memristive devices play a key role thanks to their
		  non-volatility, scalability, and compatibility with the

		  process. However, neuro-memristive systems are still facing

		  beyond conventional spike-timing dependent plasticity
		  mechanisms, by also taking into account the neuron membrane
		  potential and its firing rate. The mixed
		  memristive--neuromorphic system we demonstrate comprises an
		  oxide-based memristive synapse device placed between two
		  silicon neurons implemented on a neuromorphic chip that
		  comprises the proper interfacing and spike-based learning
		  circuits designed to drive the memristive elements. We show
		  how the system is able to emulate in real-time weight
		  dependent post-synaptic activity and drive synaptic weight
		  updates at the memristive synapse level following the

abstract	= {Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) owe their
		  success to training algorithms that use backpropagation and
		  gradient-descent. Backpropagation, while highly effective
		  on von Neumann architectures, becomes inefficient when
		  scaling to large networks. Commonly referred to as the
		  weight transport problem, each neuron's dependence on the
		  weights and errors located deeper in the network require
		  exhaustive data movement which presents a key problem in
		  enhancing the performance and energy-efficiency of
		  machine-learning hardware. In this work, we propose a
		  bio-plausible alternative to backpropagation drawing from
		  advances in feedback alignment algorithms in which the
		  error computation at a single synapse reduces to the
		  product of three scalar values. Using a sparse feedback
		  matrix, we show that a neuron needs only a fraction of the
		  information previously used by the feedback alignment
		  algorithms. Consequently, memory and compute can be
		  partitioned and distributed whichever way produces the most
		  efficient forward pass so long as a single error can be
		  delivered to each neuron. We evaluate our algorithm using
		  standard datasets, including ImageNet, to address the
		  concern of scaling to challenging problems. Our results
		  show orders of magnitude improvement in data movement and
		  2x improvement in multiply-and-accumulate operations over
		  backpropagation. Like previous work, we observe that any
		  variant of feedback alignment suffers significant losses in
		  classification accuracy on deep convolutional neural
		  networks. By transferring trained convolutional layers and
		  training the fully connected layers using direct feedback
		  alignment, we demonstrate that direct feedback alignment
		  can obtain results competitive with backpropagation.
		  Furthermore, we observe that using an extremely sparse
		  feedback matrix, rather than a dense one, results in a
		  small accuracy drop while yielding hardware advantages. All

abstract	= { Light-weight, autonomous ornithopters form a promise to
		  observe places that are too small or too dangerous for
		  humans to enter. In this article, we discuss the DelFly
		  project, in which we follow a top-down approach to ever
		  smaller and more autonomous ornithopters. Top-down
		  signifies that the project always focuses on complete
		  flying systems equipped with camera. We give arguments for
		  the approach by explaining which findings on the DelFly I
		  and DelFly II recently led to the development of the DelFly
		  Micro: a 3.07-gram ornithopter carrying a camera and
		  transmitter onboard. These findings concern the design,
		  aerodynamics, and vision-based control of the DelFly. In
		  addition, we identify main obstacles on the road to
		  fly-sized ornithopters. }

		  goal in neuroscience. Here we present a test of whether the
		  signals on neurons in cortical area V1 correspond directly
		  to our conscious perception of binocular stereoscopic
		  depth. Depth perception requires that image features on one
		  retina are first matched with appropriate features on the
		  other retina. The mechanisms that perform this matching can
		  be examined by using random-dot stereograms, in which the
		  left and right eyes view randomly positioned but
		  binocularly correlated dots. We exploit the fact that
		  anticorrelated random-dot stereograms (in which dots in one
		  eye are matched geometrically to dots of the opposite
		  contrast in the other eye) do not give rise to the
		  perception of depth because the matching process does not
		  find a consistent solution. Anticorrelated random-dot
		  stereograms contain binocular features that could excite
		  neurons that have not solved the correspondence problem. We
		  demonstrate that disparity-selective neurons in V1 signal
		  the disparity of anticorrelated random-dot stereograms,
		  indicating that they do not unambiguously signal
		  stereoscopic depth. Hence single V1 neurons cannot account
		  for the conscious perception of stereopsis, although
		  combining the outputs of many V1 neurons could solve the
		  matching problem. The accompanying paper suggests an
		  additional function for disparity signals from V1: they may
		  be important for the rapid involuntary control of vergence
		  eye movements (eye movements that bring the images on the
		  two foveae into register).}

abstract	= {Abstract Simulating biological synapses with electronic
		  devices is a re-emerging field of research. It is widely
		  recognized as the first step in hardware building
		  brain-like computers and artificial intelligent systems.
		  Thus far, different types of electronic devices have been
		  proposed to mimic synaptic functions. Among them,
		  transistor-based artificial synapses have the advantages of
		  good stability, relatively controllable testing parameters,
		  clear operation mechanism, and can be constructed from a
		  variety of materials. In addition, they can perform
		  concurrent learning, in which synaptic weight update can be
		  performed without interrupting the signal transmission
		  process. Synergistic control of one device can also be
		  implemented in a transistor-based artificial synapse, which
		  opens up the possibility of developing robust neuron
		  networks with significantly fewer neural elements. These
		  unique features of transistor-based artificial synapses
		  make them more suitable for emulating synaptic functions
		  than other types of devices. However, the development of
		  transistor-based artificial synapses is still in its very
		  early stages. Herein, this article presents a review of
		  recent advances in transistor-based artificial synapses in
		  order to give a guideline for future implementation of
		  synaptic functions with transistors. The main challenges
		  and research directions of transistor-based artificial
		  synapses are also presented.}

		  Current approaches typically rely on computing these
		  features in software using algorithms implemented on a
		  microprocessor. However, the power consumption,
		  computational latency and form factor limit their
		  applicability. In this work we take inspiration from motion
		  detection studied in the Drosophila visual system to
		  implement an alternative. The nervous system of the
		  Drosophila contains 150000 neurons [1] and computes
		  information in a parallel fashion. We propose a topology
		  comprising a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) which provides
		  input to spiking neural networks (SNN). The network is
		  realised through interconnecting leaky-integrate and fire
		  (LIF) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
		  neurons with hafnium dioxide (HfO2) based resistive random
		  access memories (RRAM) acting as the synaptic connections
		  between them. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize
		  the parameters of the network, within an experimentally
		  determined range of RRAM conductance values, and through
		  simulation it is demonstrated that the system can compute
		  the direction of motion of a grating. Finally, we
		  demonstrate that by modulating RRAM conductances and
		  adjusting network component time constants the range of
		  grating velocities to which it is most sensitive can be
		  adapted. It is also shown that this allows for the system
		  to reduce power consumption when sensitive to lower
		  velocity stimulus. This mimics the behavior observed in
		  Drosophila whereby the neuromodulator octopamine adjusts
		  the response of the motion detection system when the insect
		  is resting or flying.},

		  introducing additional input signals into the

abstract	= {The insect olfactory system, which includes the antennal
		  lobe (AL), mushroom body (MB), and ancillary structures, is
		  a relatively simple neural system capable of learning. Its
		  structural features, which are widespread in biological
		  neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade
		  of networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage
		  to stage and where sparsity and randomness play a critical
		  role in coding. Learning is partly enabled by a
		  neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation
		  of the AL, whose increased activity induces synaptic weight
		  updates in the MB through Hebbian plasticity. Enforced
		  sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that
		  are the most important for the representation of the
		  learned odor. Based upon current biophysical knowledge, we
		  have constructed an end-to-end computational firing-rate
		  model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which
		  includes the interaction of the AL and MB under octopamine
		  stimulation. Our model is able to robustly learn new odors,
		  and neural firing rates in our simulations match the
		  statistical features of in vivo firing rate data. From a
		  biological perspective, the model provides a valuable tool
		  for examining the role of neuromodulators, like octopamine,
		  in learning, and gives insight into critical interactions
		  between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during
		  learning. Our simulations also inform predictions about
		  structural details of the olfactory system that are not
		  currently well-characterized. From a machine learning
		  perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that
		  are potentially useful in constructing neural nets for
		  rapid learning from very few samples. These mechanisms
		  include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise filters,
		  and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train
		  the network based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers,
		  and Hebbian growth.},

abstract	= {Conventional vision-based robotic systems that must
		  operate quickly require high video frame rates and
		  consequently high computational costs. Visual response
		  latencies are lower-bound by the frame period, e.g., 20 ms
		  for 50 Hz frame rate. This paper shows how an asynchronous
		  neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) silicon retina is
		  used to build a fast self-calibrating robotic goalie, which
		  offers high update rates and low latency at low CPU load.
		  Independent and asynchronous per pixel illumination change
		  events from the DVS signify moving objects and are used in
		  software to track multiple balls. Motor actions to block
		  the most "threatening" ball are based on measured ball
		  positions and velocities. The goalie also sees its
		  single-axis goalie arm and calibrates the motor output map
		  during idle periods so that it can plan open-loop arm
		  movements to desired visual locations. Blocking capability
		  is about 80% for balls shot from 1 m from the goal even
		  with the fastest-shots, and approaches 100% accuracy when
		  the ball does not beat the limits of the servo motor to
		  move the arm to the necessary position in time. Running
		  with standard USB buses under a standard preemptive
		  multitasking operating system (Windows), the goalie robot
		  achieves median update rates of 550 Hz, with latencies of
		  2.2 $\pm$ 2 ms from ball movement to motor command at a
		  peak CPU load of less than 4%. Practical observations and
		  measurements of USB device latency are provided1.}

abstract	= {Plasticity circuits in the brain are known to be inuenced
		  by the distribution of the synaptic weights through the
		  mechanisms of synaptic integration and local regulation of
		  synaptic strength. However, the complex interplay of
		  stimulation-dependent plasticity with local learning
		  signals is disregarded by most of the artificial neural
		  network training algorithms devised so far. Here, we
		  propose a novel biologically inspired optimizer for
		  artificial (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) that
		  incorporates key principles of synaptic integration
		  observed in dendrites of cortical neurons: GRAPES (Group
		  Responsibility for Adjusting the Propagation of Error
		  Signals). GRAPES implements a weight-distribution dependent
		  modulation of the error signal at each node of the neural
		  network. We show that this biologically inspired mechanism
		  leads to a systematic improvement of the convergence rate
		  of the network, and substantially improves classification
		  accuracy of ANNs and SNNs with both feedforward and
		  recurrent architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
		  GRAPES supports performance scalability for models of
		  increasing complexity and mitigates catastrophic forgetting
		  by enabling networks to generalize to unseen tasks based on
		  previously acquired knowledge. The local characteristics of
		  GRAPES minimize the required memory resources, making it
		  optimally suited for dedicated hardware implementations.
		  Overall, our work indicates that reconciling
		  neurophysiology insights with machine intelligence is key
		  to boosting the performance of neural networks.}

		  characterize responses using the spectro-temporal response
		  field (STRF). The STRF describes, predicts, and fully
		  characterizes the linear dynamics of neurons in response to
		  sounds with rich spectro-temporal envelopes. It is computed
		  from the responses to elementary "ripples," a family of
		  sounds with drifting sinusoidal spectral envelopes. The
		  collection of responses to all elementary ripples is the
		  spectro-temporal transfer function. The complex
		  spectro-temporal envelope of any broadband, dynamic sound
		  can expressed as the linear sum of individual ripples.
		  Previous experiments using ripples with downward drifting
		  spectra suggested that the transfer function is separable,
		  i.e., it is reducible into a product of purely temporal and
		  purely spectral functions. Here we measure the responses to
		  upward and downward drifting ripples, assuming reparability
		  within each direction, to determine if the total
		  bidirectional transfer function is fully separable. In
		  general, the combined transfer function for two directions
		  is not symmetric, and hence units in AI are not, in
		  general, fully separable. Consequently, many AI units have
		  complex response properties such as sensitivity to
		  direction of motion, though most inseparable units are not
		  strongly directionally selective. We show that for most
		  neurons, the lack of full separability stems from
		  differences between the upward and downward spectral
		  cross-sections but not from the temporal cross-sections;
		  this places strong constraints on the neural inputs of
		  these AI units.},

abstract	= {In order to understand how the mammalian neocortex is
		  performing computations, two things are necessary; we need
		  to have a good understanding of the available neuronal
		  processing units and mechanisms, and we need to gain a
		  better understanding of how those mechanisms are combined
		  to build functioning systems. Therefore, in recent years
		  there is an increasing interest in how spiking neural
		  networks (SNN) can be used to perform complex computations
		  or solve pattern recognition tasks. However, it remains a
		  challenging task to design SNNs which use biologically
		  plausible mechanisms (especially for learning new
		  patterns), since most such SNN architectures rely on
		  training in a rate-based network and subsequent conversion
		  to a SNN. We present a SNN for digit recognition which is
		  based on mechanisms with increased biological plausibility,
		  i.e., conductance-based instead of current-based synapses,
		  spike-timing-dependent plasticity with time-dependent
		  weight change, lateral inhibition, and an adaptive spiking
		  threshold. Unlike most other systems, we do not use a
		  teaching signal and do not present any class labels to the
		  network. Using this unsupervised learning scheme, our
		  architecture achieves 95{\%} accuracy on the MNIST
		  benchmark, which is better than previous SNN
		  implementations without supervision. The fact that we used
		  no domain-specific knowledge points toward the general
		  applicability of our network design. Also, the performance
		  of our network scales well with the number of neurons used
		  and shows similar performance for four different learning
		  rules, indicating robustness of the full combination of
		  mechanisms, which suggests applicability in heterogeneous
		  biological neural networks.},

		  targets at uncued locations when a relatively long temporal
		  interval occurs between the two events. In studies which
		  have examined the time course of IOR (e.g., Samuel \& Kat
		  in Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 10, 897-906, 2003), the
		  effect is generally shown to develop at around 200 ms and
		  dissipate at around 3,000 ms following a cue. A number of
		  recent studies, however, have demonstrated that IOR can
		  develop much more quickly (up to 50 ms following a cue) and
		  last much longer (up to 13 min following a cue) in certain
		  tasks. The present study uses the multiple cuing paradigm
		  to determine whether IOR can be observed outside the
		  normally reported temporal boundaries (300-3,000 ms) when
		  attention is shifted very quickly (every 15 ms) or very
		  slowly (every 1,500 ms) throughout the visual field. IOR
		  was observed as quickly as 30 ms following cue onset and as
		  long as 6,000 ms following cue onset. Implications for the
		  role of IOR in visual search are discussed.}

abstract	= {Abstract Inaccurate subjective seizure counting poses
		  treatment and diagnostic challenges and thus suboptimal
		  quality in epilepsy management. The limitations of existing
		  hospital- and home-based monitoring solutions are
		  motivating the development of minimally invasive, subscalp,
		  implantable electroencephalography (EEG) systems with
		  accompanying cloud-based software. This new generation of
		  ultra--long-term brain monitoring systems is setting
		  expectations for a sea change in the field of clinical
		  epilepsy. From definitive diagnoses and reliable seizure
		  logs to treatment optimization and presurgical seizure foci
		  localization, the clinical need for continuous monitoring
		  of brain electrophysiological activity in epilepsy patients
		  is evident. This paper presents the converging solutions
		  developed independently by researchers and organizations
		  working at the forefront of next generation EEG monitoring.
		  The immediate value of these devices is discussed as well
		  as the potential drivers and hurdles to adoption.
		  Additionally, this paper discusses what the expected value
		  of ultra--long-term EEG data might be in the future with
		  respect to alarms for especially focal seizures, seizure
		  forecasting, and treatment personalization.}

abstract	= {In this paper, we propose a silicon-retina-based stereo
		  vision system, used for pre-crash warning respectively
		  side-impact detection applications in vehicles. The
		  bio-inspired Silicon Retina sensor is a new kind of sensor,
		  with a high temporal resolution of 1ms and a dynamic range
		  of approx. 120dB. These type of imagers deliver data
		  asynchronously and only when the intensity of the ambient
		  light changes. Therefore, the amount of data that must be
		  processed decreases significantly compared to standard CMOS
		  or CCD imagers. The sensor uses an address-event
		  representation (AER) protocol to transfer the
		  event-triggered information. Concerning these special
		  output characteristics, a novel approach regarding
		  acquisition, storage, and stereo matching of the data were
		  implemented. The concept of the algorithm is specifically
		  targeted and optimized for an implementation in hardware,
		  e.g. on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).}

abstract	= {Rhesus monkeys are widely used as animal models of human
		  attention. Such research rests upon the assumption that
		  similar mechanisms underlie attention in both species.
		  Here, we directly compare the influence of low-level
		  stimulus features on overt attention in monkeys and humans
		  under natural conditions. We recorded eye-movements in
		  humans and rhesus monkeys during free-viewing of natural
		  images. We find that intrinsic low-level features, such
		  luminance-contrast, texture-contrast and saliency as
		  predicted by a standard model, are elevated at fixation
		  points in the majority of images. These correlative effects
		  are not significantly different between species. However,
		  local image modifications affect both species differently:
		  moderate modifications, which are in the range of natural
		  fluctuations, attract overt attention in monkeys
		  significantly stronger than they do in humans. In addition,
		  humans show a higher inter-individual consistency regarding
		  which locations they fixate than monkeys, in spite of the
		  similarity for intrinsic low-level features. Taken
		  together, these data demonstrate that under natural
		  conditions low-level stimulus features affect attention in
		  monkeys and humans differently.}

abstract	= {1. Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive fields
		  was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the
		  responses of ganglion cells to grating patterns whose
		  luminance perpendicular to the bars varied sinusoidally
		  about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive
		  fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be
		  approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells)
		  summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge
		  frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly
		  increased when grating patterns drifted across their
		  receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation
		  between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting
		  sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response
		  was measured. In every case it was found that the
		  reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity
		  function, could be satisfactorily described by the
		  difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding
		  supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the
		  antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of
		  ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian
		  functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way
		  in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge
		  pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the
		  receptive field centre was determined and found to be
		  consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity
		  function. 7. Reducing the retinal illumination produced
		  changes in the contrast sensitivity function of an X-cell
		  which suggested that the diameters of the summating regions
		  of the receptive field increased while the surround region
		  became relatively ineffective.}

		  in insects, as demonstrated by electrophysiological and
		  imaging experiments. Here we analyze the detailed temporal
		  evolution of glomerular activity patterns in the antennal
		  lobe of honeybees. We represent these spatiotemporal
		  patterns as trajectories in a multidimensional space, where
		  each dimension accounts for the activity of one glomerulus.
		  Our data show that the trajectories reach odor-specific
		  steady states (attractors) that correspond to stable
		  activity patterns at about 1 second after stimulus onset.
		  As revealed by a detailed mathematical investigation, the
		  trajectories are characterized by different phases:
		  response onset, steady-state plateau, response offset, and
		  periods of spontaneous activity. An analysis based on
		  support-vector machines quantifies the odor specificity of
		  the attractors and the optimal time needed for odor
		  discrimination. The results support the hypothesis of a
		  spatial olfactory code in the antennal lobe and suggest a
		  perceptron-like readout mechanism that is biologically
		  implemented in a downstream network, such as the mushroom
		  body.},

abstract	= {Two rhesus monkeys were trained to track a small moving
		  target in the presence of a moving distractor. The target
		  and distractor were distinguished by their color. Smooth
		  pursuit eye movements were quantified in terms of the
		  latency of the eye movement and the open-loop eye
		  acceleration profile. Smooth pursuit latencies for single
		  targets were on the order of 100 msec. When the target was
		  paired with a distractor moving in the same direction as
		  the target, pursuit latencies decreased to roughly 85 msec.
		  When the target was paired with a distractor moving in the
		  opposite direction, pursuit latencies increased to roughly
		  150 msec. The motion of the distractor had no significant
		  effect on the eye acceleration profile. Experiments were
		  performed to dissociate visual search for the target from
		  pursuit initiation by providing a spatial cue rather than
		  the color cue. These experiments showed that visual search
		  necessarily preceded pursuit initiation only when the
		  distractor moved in the opposite direction relative to the
		  target. In this case, visual search contributed about 25
		  msec to the overall latency of pursuit. Control experiments
		  showed that the monkey need not attend to the distractor in
		  order for it to influence the latency of pursuit. A network
		  model was developed in which units that represent the
		  motions of the target and distractor compete against one
		  another. Attention serves to bias the outcome of this
		  competition toward the direction of the selected target.
		  The performance of this network exhibits a striking
		  parallel to the effect of the distractor on smooth pursuit
		  latency.}

		  only a few prominent neural covariation patterns. It has
		  been hypothesised that these covariation patterns could
		  form the building blocks used for fast and flexible motor
		  control. Supporting this idea, recent experiments have
		  shown that monkeys can learn to adapt their neural activity
		  in motor cortex on a timescale of minutes, given that the
		  change lies within the original low-dimensional subspace,
		  also called neural manifold. However, the neural mechanism
		  underlying this within-manifold adaptation remains unknown.
		  Here, we show in a computational model that modification of
		  recurrent weights, driven by a learned feedback signal, can
		  account for the observed behavioural difference between
		  within- and outside-manifold learning. Our findings give a
		  new perspective, showing that recurrent weight changes do
		  not necessarily lead to change in the neural manifold. On
		  the contrary, successful learning is naturally constrained
		  to a common subspace.}

		  conductance-based model neurons with dynamic synapses. The
		  method can be interpreted as a biologically plausible

		  generated by a special class of "empiric" synapses driven

abstract	= {Biologically-inspired event-driven silicon retinas, so
		  called dynamic vision sensors (DVS), allow efficient
		  solutions for various visual perception tasks, e.g.
		  surveillance, tracking, or motion detection. Similar to
		  retinal photoreceptors, any perceived light intensity
		  change in the DVS generates an event at the corresponding
		  pixel. The DVS thereby emits a stream of spatiotemporal
		  events to encode visually perceived objects that in
		  contrast to conventional frame-based cameras, is largely
		  free of redundant background information. The DVS offers
		  multiple additional advantages, but requires the
		  development of radically new asynchronous, event-based
		  information processing algorithms. In this paper we present
		  a fully event-based disparity matching algorithm for
		  reliable 3D depth perception using a dynamic cooperative
		  neural network. The interaction between cooperative cells
		  applies cross-disparity uniqueness-constraints and
		  within-disparity continuity-constraints, to asynchronously
		  extract disparity for each new event, without any need of
		  buffering individual events. We have investigated the
		  algorithm's performance in several experiments; our results
		  demonstrate smooth disparity maps computed in a purely
		  event-based manner, even in the scenes with
		  temporally-overlapping stimuli.}

		  decision making point to a fundamental distinction between
		  habitual and goaldirected action selection. The formation
		  of habits, which requires simple updating of cached values,
		  has been studied in great detail, and the reward prediction
		  error theory of dopamine function has enjoyed prominent
		  success in accounting for its neural bases. In contrast,
		  the neural circuit mechanisms of goal-directed decision
		  making, requiring extended iterative computations to
		  estimate values online, are still unknown. Here we present
		  a spiking neural network that provably solves the difficult
		  online value estimation problem underlying goal-directed
		  decision making in a near-optimal way and reproduces
		  behavioral as well as neurophysiological experimental data
		  on tasks ranging from simple binary choice to sequential
		  decision making. Our model uses local plasticity rules to
		  learn the synaptic weights of a simple neural network to
		  achieve optimal performance and solves one-step
		  decision-making tasks, commonly considered in
		  neuroeconomics, as well as more challenging sequential
		  decision-making tasks within 1 s. These decision times, and
		  their parametric dependence on task parameters, as well as
		  the final choice probabilities match behavioral data,
		  whereas the evolution of neural activities in the network
		  closely mimics neural responses recorded in frontal
		  cortices during the execution of such tasks. Our theory
		  provides a principled framework to understand the neural
		  underpinning of goal-directed decision making and makes
		  novel predictions for sequential decision-making tasks with
		  multiple rewards.},

		  key process in cortical synaptic network plasticity and
		  memory formation. Hebbian forms of LTP depend on strong
		  postsynaptic depolarization, which in many models is
		  generated by action potentials that propagate back from the
		  soma into dendrites. However, local dendritic
		  depolarization has been shown to mediate these forms of LTP
		  as well. As pyramidal cells in supragranular layers of the
		  somatosensory cortex spike infrequently, it is unclear
		  which of the two mechanisms prevails for those cells in
		  vivo. Using whole-cell recordings in the mouse
		  somatosensory cortex in vivo, we demonstrate that rhythmic
		  sensory whisker stimulation efficiently induces synaptic
		  LTP in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal cells in the absence of
		  somatic spikes. The induction of LTP depended on the
		  occurrence of NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate
		  receptor)-mediated long-lasting depolarizations, which bear
		  similarities to dendritic plateau potentials. In addition,
		  we show that whisker stimuli recruit synaptic networks that
		  originate from the posteromedial complex of the thalamus
		  (POm). Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressing
		  POm neurons generated NMDAR-mediated plateau potentials,
		  whereas the inhibition of POm activity during rhythmic
		  whisker stimulation suppressed the generation of those
		  potentials and prevented whisker-evoked LTP. Taken
		  together, our data provide evidence for sensory-driven
		  synaptic LTP in vivo, in the absence of somatic spiking.
		  Instead, LTP is mediated by plateau potentials that are
		  generated through the cooperative activity of lemniscal and
		  paralemniscal synaptic circuitry.},

		  biological neurons undergo a constant reconfiguration of

		  mechanisms. The observed growing and retracting of
		  dendritic spines can be hypothesized to be a
		  resource-optimizing strategy that limits the amount of
		  energy spent on maintaining a large number synapses that

		  Neuromorphic analog VLSI emulates biophysical processes of
		  neural tissue using CMOS transistors operated in the
		  sub-threshold regime, to achieve high energy efficiency.
		  One of the constraints that limits the scalability of
		  neuromorphic information processing architectures is the
		  number of available synapse-emulating circuits, which is
		  naturally limited by the integrated circuits (ICs) layout
		  dimensions. Here we explore the possibility to exploit
		  structural plasticity as a biologically-inspired strategy
		  for optimizing resource usage in neuromorphic processors.
		  We propose a mechanism that allocates the limited number of
		  synapses during runtime, in order to choose event-sources
		  that best contribute to the postsynaptic neurons activity.
		  In this context, we show that neuronal activity can serve
		  as an indicator of what synapse to connect to which source,
		  mimicking activity dependent dynamics of dendritic spines
		  and making optimal allocation of the resources available on
		  the neuromorphic hardware.},

abstract	= {Scientists have long conjectured that the neocortex learns
		  the structure of the environment in a predictive,
		  hierarchical manner. To do so, expected, predictable
		  features are differentiated from unexpected ones by
		  comparing bottom-up and top-down streams of data. It is
		  theorized that the neocortex then changes the
		  representation of incoming stimuli, guided by differences
		  in the responses to expected and unexpected events. Such
		  differences in cortical responses have been observed;
		  however, it remains unknown whether these unexpected event
		  signals govern subsequent changes in the brain's stimulus
		  representations, and, thus, govern learning. Here, we show
		  that unexpected event signals predict subsequent changes in
		  responses to expected and unexpected stimuli in individual
		  neurons and distal apical dendrites that are tracked over a
		  period of days. These findings were obtained by observing
		  layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in primary visual
		  cortex of awake, behaving mice using two-photon calcium
		  imaging. We found that many neurons in both layers 2/3 and
		  5 showed large differences between their responses to
		  expected and unexpected events. These unexpected event
		  signals also determined how the responses evolved over
		  subsequent days, in a manner that was different between the
		  somata and distal apical dendrites. This difference between
		  the somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for
		  hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments
		  tend to receive bottom-up and top-down information,
		  respectively. Together, our results provide novel evidence
		  that the neocortex indeed instantiates a predictive
		  hierarchical model in which unexpected events drive
		  learning.},

		  is distinguished by strong synaptic self-excitation, which
		  sustains meta-stable states of 'high' and 'low'-firing

		  activity fluctuations. In the former case, the 'high' state
		  retains a 'working memory' of a stimulus until well after
		  its release. In the latter case, 'high' states remain
		  stable for seconds, three orders of magnitude longer than
		  the largest time-scale implemented in the circuitry. Evoked
		  and spontaneous transitions form a continuum and may
		  exhibit a wide range of latencies, depending on the
		  strength of external stimulation and of recurrent synaptic
		  excitation. In addition, we investigated 'corrupted' 'high'
		  states comprising neurons of both excitatory populations.
		  Within a 'basin of attraction', the network dynamics
		  'corrects' such states and re-establishes the prototypical
		  'high' state. We conclude that, with effective theoretical
		  guidance, full-fledged attractor dynamics can be realized
		  with comparatively small populations of neuromorphic
		  hardware neurons.}

		  class of species-specific vocalizations that contain
		  naturally voiced frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. To
		  investigate how this prominent communication call element
		  is represented in primary auditory cortex (AI), neuronal
		  receptive field properties to pure-tone and synthetic,
		  logarithmically spaced FM-sweep stimuli in 3
		  barbiturate-anesthetized squirrel monkeys are studied.
		  Responses to pure tones are assessed by using standard
		  measures of frequency response areas, whereas responses to
		  FM sweeps are classified according to direction
		  selectivity, best speed, and speed tuning preferences. Most
		  neuronal clusters respond to FM sweeps in both directions
		  and over a range of FM speeds. Center frequencies
		  calculated from the average of high and low trigger
		  frequency edges of FM response profiles are highly
		  correlated with pure-tone characteristic frequencies (CFs).
		  However, bandwidth estimates are only weakly correlated
		  with their pure-tone counterparts. CF and direction
		  selectivity are negatively correlated. Best speed maps
		  reveal idiosyncratically positioned spatial aggregation of
		  similar values. In contrast, direction selectivity maps
		  show unambiguous spatial organization. Neuronal clusters
		  selective for upward-directed FM sweeps are located in
		  ventral-caudal AI, where CFs range from 0.5 to 1 kHz.
		  Combinations of pure-tone and FM response parameters form 2
		  significant factors to account for response variations.
		  These results are interpreted in the context of earlier FM
		  investigations and neuronal encoding of dynamic sounds.},

abstract	= {It was recently shown that multiple excitatory inputs to
		  CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites must be activated nearly
		  simultaneously to generate local dendritic spikes and
		  supralinear responses at the soma; even slight input
		  desynchronization prevented local spike initiation
		  (Gasparini and Magee, 2006; Losonczy and Magee, 2006). This
		  led to the conjecture that CA1 pyramidal neurons may only
		  express their non-linear integrative capabilities during
		  the highly synchronized sharp waves and ripples that occur
		  during slow wave sleep and resting/consummatory behavior,
		  whereas during active exploration and REM sleep (theta
		  rhythm), inadequate synchronization of excitation would
		  lead CA1 pyramidal cells to function as essentially linear
		  devices. Using a detailed single neuron model, we
		  replicated the experimentally observed synchronization
		  effect for brief inputs mimicking single synaptic release
		  events. When synapses were driven instead by double pulses,
		  more representative of the bursty inputs that occur in
		  vivo, we found that the tolerance for input
		  desynchronization was increased by more than an order of
		  magnitude. The effect depended mainly on paired-pulse
		  facilitation of NMDA receptor-mediated responses at
		  Schaffer collateral synapses. Our results suggest that CA1
		  pyramidal cells could function as non-linear integrative
		  units in all major hippocampal states.}

		  vision systems to perceive depth. While machine vision has
		  developed several algorithms to estimate depth from the
		  amount of defocus present at the focal plane, existing
		  techniques are slow, energy demanding and mainly relying on
		  numerous acquisitions and massive amounts of filtering
		  operations on the pixels' absolute luminance value. Recent
		  advances in neuromorphic engineering allow an alternative
		  to this problem, with the use of event-based silicon
		  retinas and neural processing devices inspired by the
		  organizing principles of the brain. In this paper, we
		  present a low power, compact and computationally
		  inexpensive setup to estimate depth in a 3D scene in real
		  time at high rates that can be directly implemented with
		  massively parallel, compact, low-latency and low-power
		  neuromorphic engineering devices. Exploiting the high
		  temporal resolution of the event-based silicon retina, we
		  are able to extract depth at 100 Hz for a power budget
		  lower than a 200 mW (10 mW for the camera, 90 mW for the
		  liquid lens and {\~{}}100 mW for the computation). We
		  validate the model with experimental results, highlighting
		  features that are consistent with both computational
		  neuroscience and recent findings in the retina physiology.
		  We demonstrate its efficiency with a prototype of a
		  neuromorphic hardware system and provide testable
		  predictions on the role of spike-based representations and
		  temporal dynamics in biological depth from defocus
		  experiments reported in the literature.}

		  extensively within the nervous system of insects and in the

		  conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and machine
		  learning algorithms cannot take advantage of this coding

		  Networks (SNNs), identifying applications where temporal

		  still an open challenge. Neuromorphic sensory-processing
		  systems provide an ideal context for exploring the

		  to efficiently extract the information required to cluster
		  or classify spatio-temporal activity patterns from relative
		  spike timing. Here we propose a neuromorphic model inspired
		  by the sand scorpion to explore the benefits of temporal
		  coding, and validate it in an event-based
		  sensory-processing task. The task consists in localizing a
		  target using only the relative spike timing of eight
		  spatially-separated vibration sensors. We propose two
		  different approaches in which the SNNs learns to cluster
		  spatio-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner and we
		  demonstrate how the task can be solved both analytically
		  and through numerical simulation of multiple SNN models. We
		  argue that the models presented are optimal for
		  spatio-temporal pattern classification using precise spike
		  timing in a task that could be used as a standard benchmark
		  for evaluating event-based sensory processing models based

		  fundamental for decision-making, and its neural correlates
		  have been found in several brain regions. Here we develop a
		  generalizable method to measure tuning curves that specify
		  the relationship between neural responses and mentally
		  accumulated evidence, and apply it to distinguish the
		  encoding of decision variables in posterior parietal cortex
		  and prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). We
		  recorded the firing rates of neurons in posterior parietal
		  cortex and FOF from rats performing a perceptual
		  decision-making task. Classical analyses uncovered
		  correlates of accumulating evidence, similar to previous
		  observations in primates and also similar across the two
		  regions. However, tuning curve assays revealed that while
		  the posterior parietal cortex encodes a graded value of the
		  accumulating evidence, the FOF has a more categorical
		  encoding that indicates, throughout the trial, the decision
		  provisionally favoured by the evidence accumulated so far.
		  Contrary to current views, this suggests that premotor
		  activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the
		  accumulation process, but instead has a more categorical
		  function, such as transforming accumulated evidence into a
		  discrete choice. To probe causally the role of FOF
		  activity, we optogenetically silenced it during different
		  time points of the trial. Consistent with a role in
		  committing to a categorical choice at the end of the
		  evidence accumulation process, but not consistent with a
		  role during the accumulation itself, a behavioural effect
		  was observed only when FOF silencing occurred at the end of
		  the perceptual stimulus. Our results place important
		  constraints on the circuit logic of brain regions involved
		  in decision-making.},

		  developed a prototype integrated circuit for wireless

		  The design of both the system-level architecture and the
		  individual circuits were driven by severe power constraints
		  for small implantable devices; chronically heating tissue
		  by only a few degrees Celsius leads to cell death. Due to
		  the high data rate produced by 100 neural signals, the
		  system must perform data reduction as well. We use a
		  combination of a low-power ADC and an array of "spike
		  detectors" to reduce the transmitted data rate while
		  preserving critical information. The complete system
		  receives power and commands (at 6.5 kb/s) wirelessly over a
		  2.64-MHz inductive link and transmits neural data back at a
		  data rate of 330 kb/s using a fully-integrated 433-MHz FSK

		  (AI) have a long and intertwined history. In more recent
		  times, however, communication and collaboration between the
		  two fields has become less commonplace. In this article, we
		  argue that better understanding biological brains could
		  play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We
		  survey historical interactions between the AI and
		  neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI
		  that have been inspired by the study of neural computation
		  in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting
		  shared themes that may be key for advancing future research

abstract	= {Neocortical regions are organized into columns and layers.
		  Connections between layers run mostly perpendicular to the
		  surface suggesting a columnar functional organization. Some
		  layers have long-range excitatory lateral connections
		  suggesting interactions between columns. Similar patterns
		  of connectivity exist in all regions but their exact role
		  remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a network model
		  composed of columns and layers that performs robust object
		  learning and recognition. Each column integrates its
		  changing input over time to learn complete predictive
		  models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections
		  across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer
		  objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns.
		  Because columns integrate input over time and space, the
		  network learns models of complex objects that extend well
		  beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network
		  model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We
		  propose that a representation of location relative to the
		  object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular
		  layers of each column. The location signal is provided as
		  an input to the network, where it is combined with sensory
		  data. Our model contains two layers and one or more
		  columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning
		  rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize
		  hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of
		  features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with
		  significantly fewer movements of the sensory receptors.
		  Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity
		  patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns
		  and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling
		  capabilities than previously assumed.}

		  actively maintained representations in the prefrontal
		  cortex, which are dynamically updated/gated by the basal
		  ganglia. It is capable of developing human-like performance
		  largely on its own by taking advantage of powerful
		  reinforcement learning mechanisms, based on the midbrain
		  dopaminergic system and its activation via the basal
		  ganglia and amygdala. These learning mechanisms enable the

abstract	= {Humans spend a lot of time searching for things, such as
		  roadside traffic signs1, soccer balls2 or tumours in
		  mammograms3. These tasks involve the deployment of
		  attention from one item in the visual field to the next.
		  Common sense suggests that rejected items should be noted
		  in some fashion so that effort is not expended in
		  re-examining items that have been attended to and rejected.
		  However, common sense is wrong. Here we asked human
		  observers to search for a letter 'T' among letters 'L'.
		  This search demandsvisual attention and normally proceeds
		  at a rate of 20-30 milliseconds per item4. In the critical
		  condition, we randomly relocated all letters every 111
		  milliseconds. This made it impossible for the subjects to
		  keep track of the progress of the search. Nevertheless, the
		  efficiency of the search was unchanged. Theories of visual
		  search all assume that search relies on accumulating
		  information about the identity of objects over time5-7.
		  Such theories predict that search efficiency will be
		  drastically reduced if the scene is continually shuffled
		  while the observer is trying to search through it. As we
		  show that efficiency is not impaired, the standard theories
		  must be revised.}

abstract	= {Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) have been widely
		  used in many applications, particularly in machine vision.
		  It is challenging to accelerate {DNNs} on embedded systems
		  because real-world machine vision applications should
		  reserve a lot of external memory bandwidth for other tasks,
		  such as video capture and display while leaving little
		  bandwidth for accelerating DNNs. In order to solve this
		  issue, in this study, we propose a high-throughput
		  accelerator, called reconfigurable tiny neural-network
		  accelerator (ReTiNNA) for the bandwidth-limited system, and
		  present a real-time object detection system for the
		  high-resolution video image. We first present a dedicated
		  computation engine that takes different data mapping
		  methods for various filter types to improve data reuse and
		  reduce hardware resources. We then propose an adaptive
		  layer-wise tiling strategy that tiles the feature maps into
		  strips to reduce the control complexity of data
		  transmission dramatically and to improve the efficiency of
		  data transmission. Finally, a design space exploration
		  (DSE) approach is presented to explore design space more
		  accurately in the case of insufficient bandwidth to improve
		  the performance of the low-bandwidth accelerator. With a
		  low bandwidth of 2.23 GB/s and a low hardware consumption
		  of 90.261K LUTs and 448 DSPs, ReTiNNA can still achieve a
		  high performance of 155.86 GOPS on VGG16 and 68.20 GOPS on
		  ResNet50, which is better than other state-of-the-art
		  designs implemented on FPGA devices. Furthermore, the
		  real-time object detection system can achieve a high object
		  detection speed of 19 fps for high-resolution video.}

abstract	= {The development of power-efficient neuromorphic devices
		  presents the challenge of designing spike pattern
		  classification algorithms which can be implemented on
		  low-precision hardware and can also achieve
		  state-of-the-art performance. In our pursuit of meeting
		  this challenge, we present a pattern classification model
		  which uses a sparse connection matrix and exploits the
		  mechanism of nonlinear dendritic processing to achieve high
		  classification accuracy. A rate-based structural learning
		  rule for multiclass classification is proposed which
		  modifies a connectivity matrix of binary synaptic
		  connections by choosing the best "k" out of "d" inputs to
		  make connections on every dendritic branch (k {\textless}
		  {\textless} d). Because learning only modifies
		  connectivity, the model is well suited for implementation
		  in neuromorphic systems using address-event representation
		  (AER). We develop an ensemble method which combines several
		  dendritic classifiers to achieve enhanced generalization
		  over individual classifiers. We have two major findings:
		  (1) Our results demonstrate that an ensemble created with
		  classifiers comprising moderate number of dendrites
		  performs better than both ensembles of perceptrons and of
		  complex dendritic trees. (2) In order to determine the
		  moderate number of dendrites required for a specific
		  classification problem, a two-step solution is proposed.
		  First, an adaptive approach is proposed which scales the
		  relative size of the dendritic trees of neurons for each
		  class. It works by progressively adding dendrites with
		  fixed number of synapses to the network, thereby allocating
		  synaptic resources as per the complexity of the given
		  problem. As a second step, theoretical capacity
		  calculations are used to convert each neuronal dendritic
		  tree to its optimal topology where dendrites of each class
		  are assigned different number of synapses. The performance
		  of the model is evaluated on classification of handwritten
		  digits from the benchmark MNIST dataset and compared with
		  other spike classifiers. We show that our system can
		  achieve classification accuracy within 1-2{\%} of other
		  reported spike-based classifiers while using much less
		  synaptic resources (only 7{\%}) compared to that used by
		  other methods. Further, an ensemble classifier created with
		  adaptively learned sizes can attain accuracy of 96.4{\%}
		  which is at par with the best reported performance of
		  spike-based classifiers. Moreover, the proposed method
		  achieves this by using about 20{\%} of the synapses used by
		  other spike algorithms. We also present results of applying
		  our algorithm to classify the MNIST-DVS dataset collected
		  from a real spike-based image sensor and show results
		  comparable to the best reported ones (88.1{\%} accuracy).
		  For VLSI implementations, we show that the reduced synaptic
		  memory can save upto 4X area compared to conventional
		  crossbar topologies. Finally, we also present a
		  biologically realistic spike-based version for calculating
		  the correlations required by the structural learning rule
		  and demonstrate the correspondence between the rate-based
		  and spike-based methods of learning.},

		  This is an extremely challenging endeavor that requires
		  researchers in multiple disciplines to combine their

		  methods, the supporting computing architectures, and their
		  underlying technologies. The journal "Neuromorphic

		  support this new community in this effort and provide a

		  serves a growing transdisciplinary and dynamic community
		  across academia and industry.}

abstract	= {Recent advances in neuroscience are revealing the
		  principles of neural computation used by the mammalian
		  brain [7], while modeling studies show how neural
		  architectures composed of diversified and unreliable
		  computing elements (neurons and synapses) can support
		  robust and reliable computation using computational
		  primitives of both analog and digital nature [10]. It is
		  now clear that the principles of computation used by
		  nervous systems are radically different from those
		  generally used in current computers. Unlike computers,
		  neuronal networks process information using
		  energy-efficient asynchronous, event-driven, methods. They
		  are self-constructing and repairing, self-programming, and
		  they are able to flexibly compose complex behaviors from
		  simpler elements. These biological abilities offer an
		  attractive alternative to conventional computing
		  technology, and could have enormous consequences for future
		  generations of artificial information processing and
		  behaving systems. The quest to design and fabricate
		  electronic neural systems composed of, for example,
		  retinas, cochles, and neuronal networks whose architecture
		  and design principles are based on those of biological
		  nervous systems is known as neuromorphic engineering [4,
		  18]. In this chapter, we describe some general properties
		  of neuromorphic systems, and also how neurons and synapses
		  can be implemented in the CMOS (com-plimentary metal-oxide
		  semiconductor) electronic medium using hybrid
		  analog/digital VLSI (very large scale integrated)
		  technology. 10.1 Neuromorphic vs. Conventional Use of VLSI
		  Technology The primary feature of the vast majority of
		  conventional VLSI circuits is that they are purely digital:
		  They use transistors as on-off switches, and they represent
		  numbers as collections of binary digits. Because these
		  circuits use only a binary encoding, it is possible to
		  reduce the performance of their component transistors to
		  the extent that they only reliably determine a single bit.
		  These simple bits can then be combined to 10-1},

abstract	= {Information theory is a practical and theoretical

		  As a framework it has a number of useful properties: it
		  provides a general measure sensitive to any relationship,
		  not only linear effects; its quantities have meaningful
		  units which in many cases allow direct comparison between
		  different experiments; and it can be used to study how much
		  information can be gained by observing neural responses in
		  single experimental trials, rather than in averages over
		  multiple trials. A variety of information theoretic
		  quantities are in common use in neuroscience - including
		  the Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and
		  mutual information. In this entry, we introduce and define
		  these quantities. Further details on how these quantities

		  connections to neuroscience. As a consequence, they have
		  largely ignored key features of biological neural
		  processing systems, such as their extremely low-power
		  consumption features or their ability to carry out robust
		  and efficient computation using massively parallel arrays
		  of limited precision, highly variable, and unreliable
		  components. Recent developments in nano-technologies are
		  making available extremely compact and low power, but also
		  variable and unreliable solid-state devices that can
		  potentially extend the offerings of availing CMOS
		  technologies. In particular, memristors are regarded as a
		  promising solution for modeling key features of biological
		  synapses due to their nanoscale dimensions, their capacity
		  to store multiple bits of information per element and the
		  low energy required to write distinct states. In this
		  paper, we first review the neuro- and neuromorphic
		  computing approaches that can best exploit the properties
		  of memristor and scale devices, and then propose a novel
		  hybrid memristor-CMOS neuromorphic circuit which represents
		  a radical departure from conventional neuro-computing
		  approaches, as it uses memristors to directly emulate the
		  biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses. We point
		  out the differences between the use of memristors in
		  conventional neuro-computing architectures and the hybrid

		  represents an ideal building block for implementing
		  brain-inspired probabilistic computing paradigms that are
		  robust to variability and fault tolerant by design.}

		  foveation filter then blurs every frame, increasingly with
		  distance from salient locations. Sixty-three variants of

		  Two variants of the algorithm are validated against eye

		  heterogeneous collection of 50 video clips (over 45 000
		  frames in total). Significantly higher overlap than

abstract	= {Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye
		  movements or covert shifts of attention, are based on the
		  concept of a saliency map, that is, an explicit
		  two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or
		  conspicuity of objects in the visual environment.
		  Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a
		  single winning location that corresponds to the next
		  attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically
		  allows the system to attend to the next most salient
		  location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of
		  such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining
		  information across modalities, here orientation, intensity
		  and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner.
		  The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as
		  well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its
		  successful performance is used to address the extent to
		  which the primate visual system carries out visual search
		  via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be
		  tested.}

abstract	= {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on
		  computational models of focal visual attention that
		  emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of attentional
		  deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli
		  critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a
		  unique saliency map that topographically encodes for
		  stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be
		  an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy.
		  Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the
		  currently attended location is prevented from being
		  attended again, is a crucial element of attentional
		  deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly
		  interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to
		  the coordinate system used to control attention. And last,
		  scene understanding and object recognition strongly
		  constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights
		  from these five key areas provide a framework for a
		  computational and neurobiological understanding of visual
		  attention.}

abstract	= {Rather than attempting to fully interpret visual scenes in
		  a parallel fashion, biological systems appear to employ a
		  serial strategy by which an attentional spotlight rapidly
		  selects circumscribed regions in the scene for further
		  analysis. The spatiotemporal deployment of attention has
		  been shown to be controlled by both bottom-up (image-based)
		  and top-down (volitional) cues. We describe a detailed
		  neuromimetic computer implementation of a bottom-up scheme
		  for the control of visual attention, focusing on the
		  problem of combining information across modalities
		  (orientation, intensity, and color information) in a purely
		  stimulus-driven manner. We have applied this model to a
		  wide range of target detection tasks, using synthetic and
		  natural stimuli. Performance has, however, remained
		  difficult to objectively evaluate on natural scenes,
		  because no objective reference was available for
		  comparison. We present predicted search times for our model
		  on the Search\_2 database of rural scenes containing a
		  military vehicle. Overall, we found a poor correlation
		  between human and model search times. Further analysis,
		  however, revealed that in 75\% of the images, the model
		  appeared to detect the target faster than humans (for
		  comparison, we calibrated the model's arbitrary internal
		  time frame such that 2 to 4 image locations were visited
		  per second). It seems that this model, which had originally
		  been designed not to find small, hidden military vehicles,
		  but rather to find the few most obviously conspicuous
		  objects in an image, performed as an efficient target
		  detector on the Search\_2 dataset. Further developments of
		  the model are finally explored, in particular through a
		  more formal treatment of the difficult problem of
		  extracting suitable low-level features to be fed into the
		  saliency map.}

abstract	= {The acceleration race of digital computing technologies
		  seems to be steering toward impasses -- technological,
		  economical and environmental -- a condition that has
		  spurred research efforts in alternative, "neuromorphic"
		  (brain-like) computing technologies. Furthermore, since
		  decades the idea of exploiting nonlinear physical phenomena
		  "directly" for non-digital computing has been explored
		  under names like "unconventional computing", "natural
		  computing", "physical computing", or "in-materio
		  computing". In this article I investigate coordinates and
		  conditions for a generalized concept of "computing" which
		  comprises digital, neuromorphic, unconventional and
		  possible future "computing" paradigms. The main
		  contribution of this paper is an in-depth inspection of
		  existing formal conceptualizations of "computing" in
		  discrete-symbolic, probabilistic, and dynamical-systems
		  oriented views. It turns out that different choices of
		  background mathematics lead to decisively different
		  understandings of what "computing" is. However, across this
		  diversity a unifying coordinate system for theorizing about
		  "computing" can be distilled.}

abstract	= {Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) has been the
		  mainstay of identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ), a key
		  diagnostic procedure in addition to neuroimaging when
		  considering epilepsy surgery. In many patients, iEEG has
		  been the basis for resective epilepsy surgery, to date
		  still the most successful treatment for drug-resistant
		  epilepsy. Intracranial EEG determines the location and
		  resectability of the SOZ. Advances in recording and
		  implantation of iEEG provide multiple options in the 21st
		  century. This not only includes the choice between subdural
		  electrodes (SDE) and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)
		  but also includes the implantation and recordings from
		  microelectrodes. Before iEEG implantation, especially in
		  magnetic resonance imaging -negative epilepsy, a clear
		  hypothesis for seizure generation and propagation should be
		  based on noninvasive methods. Intracranial EEG implantation
		  should be planned by a multidisciplinary team considering
		  epileptic networks. Recordings from SDE and SEEG have both
		  their advantages and disadvantages. Stereo-EEG seems to
		  have a lower rate of complications that are clinically
		  significant, but has limitations in spatial sampling of the
		  cortical surface. Stereo-EEG can sample deeper areas of the
		  brain including deep sulci and hard to reach areas such as
		  the insula. To determine the epileptogenic zone, interictal
		  and ictal information should be taken into consideration.
		  Interictal spiking, low frequency slowing, as well as high
		  frequency oscillations may inform about the epileptogenic
		  zone. Ictally, high frequency onsets in the beta/gamma
		  range are usually associated with the SOZ, but specialized
		  recordings with combined macro and microelectrodes may in
		  the future educate us about onset in higher frequency
		  bands. Stimulation of intracranial electrodes triggering
		  habitual seizures can assist in identifying the SOZ.
		  Advanced computational methods such as determining the
		  epileptogenicity index and similar measures may enhance
		  standard clinical interpretation. Improved techniques to
		  record and interpret iEEG may in the future lead to a
		  greater proportion of patients being seizure free after
		  epilepsy surgery.}

		  Depth perception through stereo vision is an important
		  feature of biological and artificial vision systems. While
		  biological systems can compute disparities effortlessly, it
		  requires intensive processing for artificial vision
		  systems. The computing complexity resides in solving the
		  correspondence problem -- finding matching pairs of points
		  in the two eyes. Inspired by the retina, event-based vision
		  sensors allow a new constraint to solve the correspondence
		  problem: time. Relying on precise spike-time, spiking
		  neural networks can take advantage of this constraint.
		  However, disparities can only be computed from dynamic
		  environments since event-based vision sensors only report
		  local changes in light intensity. In this paper, we show
		  how microsaccadic eye movements can be used to compute
		  disparities from static environments. To this end, we built
		  a robotic head supporting two Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS)
		  capable of independent panning and simultaneous tilting. We
		  evaluate the method on both static and dynamic scenes
		  perceived through microsaccades. This paper demonstrates
		  the complementarity of event-based vision sensors and
		  active perception leading to more biologically inspired
		  robots.},

abstract	= {The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information
		  processing machine. Spatio- and spectro-temporal brain data
		  (STBD) are the most commonly collected data for measuring
		  brain response to external stimuli. An enormous amount of
		  such data has been already collected, including brain
		  structural and functional data under different conditions,
		  molecular and genetic data, in an attempt to make a
		  progress in medicine, health, cognitive science,
		  engineering, education, neuro-economics, Brain-Computer
		  Interfaces (BCI), and games. Yet, there is no unifying
		  computational framework to deal with all these types of
		  data in order to better understand this data and the
		  processes that generated it. Standard machine learning
		  techniques only partially succeeded and they were not
		  designed in the first instance to deal with such complex
		  data. Therefore, there is a need for a new paradigm to deal
		  with STBD. This paper reviews some methods of spiking
		  neural networks (SNN) and argues that SNN are suitable for
		  the creation of a unifying computational framework for
		  learning and understanding of various STBD, such as EEG,
		  fMRI, genetic, DTI, MEG, and NIRS, in their integration and
		  interaction. One of the reasons is that SNN use the same
		  computational principle that generates STBD, namely spiking
		  information processing. This paper introduces a new SNN
		  architecture, called NeuCube, for the creation of concrete
		  models to map, learn and understand STBD. A NeuCube model
		  is based on a 3D evolving SNN that is an approximate map of
		  structural and functional areas of interest of the brain
		  related to the modeling STBD. Gene information is included
		  optionally in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRN) if
		  this is relevant to the problem and the data. A NeuCube
		  model learns from STBD and creates connections between
		  clusters of neurons that manifest chains (trajectories) of
		  neuronal activity. Once learning is applied, a NeuCube
		  model can reproduce these trajectories, even if only part
		  of the input STBD or the stimuli data is presented, thus
		  acting as an associative memory. The NeuCube framework can
		  be used not only to discover functional pathways from data,
		  but also as a predictive system of brain activities, to
		  predict and possibly, prevent certain events. Analysis of
		  the internal structure of a model after training can reveal
		  important spatio-temporal relationships 'hidden' in the
		  data. NeuCube will allow the integration in one model of
		  various brain data, information and knowledge, related to a
		  single subject (personalized modeling) or to a population
		  of subjects. The use of NeuCube for classification of STBD
		  is illustrated in a case study problem of EEG data. NeuCube
		  models result in a better accuracy of STBD classification
		  than standard machine learning techniques. They are robust
		  to noise (so typical in brain data) and facilitate a better
		  interpretation of the results and understanding of the STBD
		  and the brain conditions under which data was collected.
		  Future directions for the use of SNN for STBD are
		  discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

		  colliculus (SC) acts as an optimal controller for saccadic
		  gaze shifts. The SC is proposed to be the site within the
		  visuomotor system where the nonlinear spatial-to-temporal
		  transformation is carried out: the population encodes the
		  intended saccade vector by its location in the motor map
		  (spatial), and its trajectory and velocity by the
		  distribution of firing rates (temporal). The neurons' burst
		  profiles vary systematically with their anatomical
		  positions and intended saccade vectors, to account for the
		  nonlinear main-sequence kinematics of saccades. Yet, the
		  underlying collicular mechanisms that could result in these
		  firing patterns are inaccessible to current neurobiological
		  techniques. Here, we propose a simple spiking neural
		  network model that reproduces the spike trains of
		  saccade-related cells in the intermediate and deep SC
		  layers during saccades. The model assumes that SC neurons
		  have distinct biophysical properties for spike generation
		  that depend on their anatomical position in combination
		  with a center-surround lateral connectivity. Both factors
		  are needed to account for the observed firing patterns. Our
		  model offers a basis for neuronal algorithms for

		  regions. Using a biophysical model, we show that synaptic
		  input by NMDA receptors can cause such membrane potential
		  fluctuations. In this model, when a neuron is driven by two
		  input pathways with different AMPA/NMDA receptor content,
		  the NMDA-rich input causes up-state transitions, whereas
		  the AMPA-rich input generates spikes only in the up-state.
		  Therefore the NMDA-rich pathway can gate input from an AMPA
		  pathway in an all-or-none fashion by switching between
		  different membrane potential states. Furthermore, once in
		  the up-state, the NMDA-rich pathway multiplicatively
		  increases the gain of a neuron responding to AMPArich
		  input. This proposed mechanism for two-state fluctuations
		  directly suggests specific computations, such as gating and
		  gain modulation based on the distinct receptor composition
		  of different neuronal pathways. The dynamic gating of input

abstract	= {Subjects performed a concurrent smooth pursuit and
		  perceptual task to determine whether smooth pursuit eye
		  movements and perception share the same attentional
		  mechanism. Subjects pursued a pair of eccentric rows of
		  moving characters while simultaneously attempting to
		  identify and locate the single numeral in these target rows
		  and the single numeral in a pair of untracked background
		  rows, which moved at a different velocity. Average smooth
		  pursuit gain (eye velocity/target velocity) was 0.7 to 1.
		  Visual search was better for target rows (~ 65\% correct)
		  than for background rows (~ 22\% correct). Superior search
		  performance for the target was not due to its lower retinal
		  speed: performance on the target was 2-3 times better than
		  on the background when retinal speeds were the same.
		  Superior performance for the pursuit target suggests that
		  smooth eye movements and perception share the same
		  selective attentional mechanism. A shared attentional
		  mechanism was further supported by findings that subjects
		  could not: (1) maintain a stable line of sight on a central
		  stationary point while simultaneously attending to moving
		  rows; and (2) pursue one pair of rows and attend the other,
		  untracked rows. Attempts to attend untracked rows did,
		  however, produce a partial improvement in search
		  performance which was accompanied by only a very slight
		  change in eye velocity. This demonstrates that the effects
		  of decisions about how to apportion attention across the
		  visual field depend on the task. Despite the common
		  selective attentional mechanism, smooth eye movements do
		  not provide accurate external indicators of attention
		  unless the consequences of attentional decisions for
		  performance are determined separately for oculomotor and
		  for perceptual tasks.}

		  While the output of recurrent network models can learn to

		  dynamics that emerge after learning remains unknown. Here
		  we show that modifying the recurrent connectivity with a
		  recursive least squares algorithm provides sufficient
		  flexibility for synaptic and spiking rate dynamics of
		  spiking networks to produce a wide range of spatiotemporal
		  activity. We apply the training method to learn arbitrary
		  firing patterns, stabilize irregular spiking activity in a
		  network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons respecting
		  Dale's law, and reproduce the heterogeneous spiking rate
		  patterns of cortical neurons engaged in motor planning and
		  movement. We identify sufficient conditions for successful
		  learning, characterize two types of learning errors, and
		  assess the network capacity. Our findings show that
		  synaptically-coupled recurrent spiking networks possess a
		  vast computational capability that can support the diverse
		  activity patterns in the brain.},

		  is then delayed responding to stimuli subsequently

		  (IOR)', encourages orienting towards novel locations and
		  hence might facilitate foraging and other search behaviors.
		  Since its relatively recent discovery, IOR has been the

		  with a wide variety of approaches. After describing the
		  seminal contribution of Posner and Cohen ("Who"), this

		  what effects IOR has on subsequent processing ("What"). The
		  time course ("When") and spatial distribution ("Where") of
		  IOR, and what is known about IOR's neural implementation
		  ("How") and functional significance ("Why") are also

abstract	= {This paper presents a silicon retina-based stereo vision
		  system, which is used for a pre-crash warning application
		  for side impacts. We use silicon retina imagers for this
		  task, because the advantages of the camera, derived from
		  the human vision system, are high temporal resolution up to
		  1ms and the handling of various lighting conditions with a
		  dynamic range of {\textasciitilde}120dB. A silicon retina
		  delivers asynchronous data which are called address events
		  (AE). Different stereo matching algorithms are available,
		  but these algorithms normally work with full frame images.
		  In this paper we evaluate how the AE data from the silicon
		  retina sensors must be adapted to work with full-frame
		  area-based and feature-based stereo matching algorithms.}

abstract	= {The ionic conductance models of neuronal cells can finely
		  reproduce a wide variety of complex neuronal activities.
		  However, the complexity of these models has prompted the
		  development of qualitative neuron models. They are
		  described by differential equations with a reduced number
		  of variables and their low-dimensional polynomials, which
		  retain the core mathematical structures. Such simple models
		  form the foundation of a bottom-up approach in
		  computational and theoretical neuroscience. We proposed a
		  qualitative-modeling-based approach for designing silicon
		  neuron circuits, in which the mathematical structures in
		  the polynomial-based qualitative models are reproduced by
		  differential equations with silicon-native expressions.
		  This approach can realize low-power-consuming circuits that
		  can be configured to realize various classes of neuronal
		  cells. In this article, our qualitative-modeling-based
		  silicon neuron circuits for analog and digital
		  implementations are quickly reviewed. One of our CMOS
		  analog silicon neuron circuits can realize a variety of
		  neuronal activities with a power consumption less than 72
		  nW. The square-wave bursting mode of this circuit is
		  explained. Another circuit can realize Class I and II
		  neuronal activities with about 3 nW. Our digital silicon
		  neuron circuit can also realize these classes. An

		  projecting neurons, synaptic inputs are weighted with a
		  heterogeneous set of weights. We propose that synaptic
		  weights reflect the role of each neuron within the
		  population for the computational task that the network has
		  to solve. In our case, the computational task is
		  discrimination of binary classes of stimuli, and weights
		  are such as to maximize the discrimination capacity of the
		  network. We compute synaptic weights as the feature weights
		  of an optimal linear classifier. Once weights have been
		  learned, they weight spike trains and allow to compute the
		  post-synaptic current that modulates the spiking
		  probability of the read-out unit in real time. We apply the
		  model on parallel spike trains from V1 and V4 areas in the
		  behaving monkey macaca mulatta, while the animal is engaged
		  in a visual discrimination task with binary classes of
		  stimuli. The read-out of spike trains with our model allows
		  to discriminate the two classes of stimuli, while
		  population PSTH entirely fails to do so. Splitting neurons
		  in two subpopulations according to the sign of the weight,
		  we show that population signals of the two functional
		  subnetworks are negatively correlated. Disentangling the
		  superficial, the middle and the deep layer of the cortex,
		  we show that in both V1 and V4, superficial layers are the
		  most important in discriminating binary classes of

abstract	= {1. Responses of single units and multiunit clusters were
		  recorded in the ferret primary auditory cortex (AI) with
		  the use of broadband complex dynamic spectra. Previous work
		  has demonstrated that simpler spectra consisting of single
		  moving ripples (i.e., sinusoidally modulated spectral
		  profiles that travel at a constant velocity along the
		  logarithmic frequency axis) could be used effectively to
		  characterize the response fields and transfer functions of
		  AI cells. 2. A complex dynamic spectral profile can be
		  thought of as being the sum of moving ripple spectra. Such
		  a decomposition can be computed from a two-dimensional
		  spectrotemporal Fourier transform of the dynamic spectral
		  profile with moving ripples as the basis function. 3.
		  Therefore, if AI units were essentially linear, satisfying
		  the superposition principle, then their responses to
		  arbitrary dynamic spectra could be predicted from the
		  responses to single moving ripples, i.e., from the units'
		  response fields and transfer functions (spectral and
		  temporal impulse response functions, respectively). 4. This
		  conjecture was tested and confirmed with data from 293
		  combinations of moving ripples, involving complex spectra
		  composed of up to 15 moving ripples of different ripple
		  frequencies and velocities. For each case, response
		  predictions based on the unit transfer functions were
		  compared with measured responses. The correlation between
		  predicted and measured responses was found to be
		  consistently high (84\% with rho > 0.6). 5. The
		  distribution of response parameters suggests that AI cells
		  may encode the profile of a dynamic spectrum by performing
		  a multiscale spectrotemporal decomposition of the dynamic
		  spectral profile in a largely linear manner.},

		  on the turning side; (2) the cycle duration increases in

		  realized in Intel's neuromorphic research chip, Loihi, and
		  precisely integrates the issued motor commands to estimate
		  the iCub's head pose in a neuronal path-integration
		  process. The neuromorphic vision system of the iCub is used
		  to correct for drift in the pose estimation. Positions of

abstract	= {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are potentially highly
		  efficient models for inference on fully parallel
		  neuromorphic hardware, but existing training methods that
		  convert conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) into
		  SNNs are unable to exploit these advantages. Although
		  ANN-to-SNN conversion has achieved state-of-the-art
		  accuracy for static image classification tasks, the
		  following subtle but important difference in the way SNNs
		  and ANNs integrate information over time makes the direct
		  application of conversion techniques for sequence
		  processing tasks challenging. Whereas all connections in
		  SNNs have a certain propagation delay larger than zero,
		  ANNs assign different roles to feed-forward connections,
		  which immediately update all neurons within the same time
		  step, and recurrent connections, which have to be rolled
		  out in time and are typically assigned a delay of one time
		  step. Here, we present a novel method to obtain highly
		  accurate SNNs for sequence processing by modifying the ANN
		  training before conversion, such that delays induced by ANN
		  rollouts match the propagation delays in the targeted SNN
		  implementation. Our method builds on the recently
		  introduced framework of streaming rollouts, which aims for
		  fully parallel model execution of ANNs and inherently
		  allows for temporal integration by merging paths of
		  different delays between input and output of the network.
		  The resulting networks achieve state-of-the-art accuracy
		  for multiple event-based benchmark datasets, including
		  <monospace>N-MNIST</monospace>,
		  <monospace>CIFAR10-DVS</monospace>,
		  <monospace>N-CARS</monospace>, and
		  <monospace>DvsGesture</monospace>, and through the use of
		  spatio-temporal shortcut connections yield low-latency
		  approximate network responses that improve over time as
		  more of the input sequence is processed. In addition, our
		  converted SNNs are consistently more energy-efficient than
		  their corresponding ANNs.}

abstract	= {We present a simple model for coherent, spatially
		  correlated chaos in a recurrent neural network. Networks of
		  randomly connected neurons exhibit chaotic fluctuations and
		  have been studied as a model for capturing the temporal
		  variability of cortical activity. The dynamics generated by
		  such networks, however, are spatially uncorrelated and do
		  not generate coherent fluctuations, which are commonly
		  observed across spatial scales of the neocortex. In our
		  model we introduce a structured component of connectivity,
		  in addition to random connections, which effectively embeds
		  a feedforward structure via unidirectional coupling between
		  a pair of orthogonal modes. Local fluctuations driven by
		  the random connectivity are summed by an output mode and
		  drive coherent activity along an input mode. The
		  orthogonality between input and output mode preserves
		  chaotic fluctuations by preventing feedback loops. In the
		  regime of weak structured connectivity we apply a
		  perturbative approach to solve the dynamic mean-field
		  equations, showing that in this regime coherent
		  fluctuations are driven passively by the chaos of local
		  residual fluctuations. When we introduce a row balance
		  constraint on the random connectivity, stronger structured
		  connectivity puts the network in a distinct dynamical
		  regime of self-tuned coherent chaos. In this regime the
		  coherent component of the dynamics self-adjusts
		  intermittently to yield periods of slow, highly coherent
		  chaos. The dynamics display longer time-scales and
		  switching-like activity. We show how in this regime the
		  dynamics depend qualitatively on the particular realization
		  of the connectivity matrix: a complex leading eigenvalue
		  can yield coherent oscillatory chaos while a real leading
		  eigenvalue can yield chaos with broken symmetry. The level
		  of coherence grows with increasing strength of structured
		  connectivity until the dynamics are almost entirely
		  constrained to a single spatial mode. We examine the
		  effects of network-size scaling and show that these results

		  directly to control a robotic manipulator, research on
		  brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has experienced an
		  impressive growth. Today BMIs designed for both
		  experimental and clinical studies can translate raw
		  neuronal signals into motor commands that reproduce arm
		  reaching and hand grasping movements in artificial
		  actuators. Clearly, these developments hold promise for the
		  restoration of limb mobility in paralyzed subjects.
		  However, as we review here, before this goal can be reached
		  several bottlenecks have to be passed. These include
		  designing a fully implantable biocompatible recording
		  device, further developing real-time computational
		  algorithms, introducing a method for providing the brain
		  with sensory feedback from the actuators, and designing and
		  building artificial prostheses that can be controlled
		  directly by brain-derived signals. By reaching these
		  milestones, future BMIs will be able to drive and control
		  revolutionary prostheses that feel and act like the human

		  the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex
		  serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up
		  observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic

		  improving the latency and energy efficiency of deep neural
		  networks through data-driven event-based computation.
		  However, training such networks is difficult due to the
		  non-differentiable nature of spike events. In this paper,
		  we introduce a novel technique, which treats the membrane
		  potentials of spiking neurons as differentiable signals,
		  where discontinuities at spike times are considered as
		  noise. This enables an error backpropagation mechanism for
		  deep SNNs that follows the same principles as in
		  conventional deep networks, but works directly on spike
		  signals and membrane potentials. Compared with previous
		  methods relying on indirect training and conversion, our
		  technique has the potential to capture the statistics of
		  spikes more precisely. We evaluate the proposed framework
		  on artificially generated events from the original MNIST
		  handwritten digit benchmark, and also on the N-MNIST
		  benchmark recorded with an event-based dynamic vision
		  sensor, in which the proposed method reduces the error rate
		  by a factor of more than three compared to the best
		  previous SNN, and also achieves a higher accuracy than a
		  conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) trained and
		  tested on the same data. We demonstrate in the context of
		  the MNIST task that thanks to their event-driven operation,
		  deep SNNs (both fully connected and convolutional) trained
		  with our method achieve accuracy equivalent with
		  conventional neural networks. In the N-MNIST example,
		  equivalent accuracy is achieved with about five times fewer
		  computational operations.}

		  build a reliable system we need components that

		  well known that neurons, the building blocks of brains, do
		  not satisfy this constraint. Even neurons of the same type
		  come with huge variances in their properties and these
		  properties also vary over time. Synapses, the connections
		  between neurons, are highly unreliable in forwarding
		  signals. In this paper we argue that both these fact add
		  variance to neuronal processes, and that this variance is
		  not a handicap of neural systems, but that instead
		  predictable and reliable functional behavior of neural
		  systems depends crucially on this variability. In
		  particular, we show that higher variance allows a
		  recurrently connected neural population to react more
		  sensitively to incoming signals, and processes them faster
		  and more energy efficient. This, for example, challenges
		  the general assumption that the intrinsic variability of
		  neurons in the brain is a defect that has to be overcome by
		  synaptic plasticity in the process of learning.}

		  high cost of spikes requires the brain not only to use

abstract	= {State-dependent computation is one of the main signatures
		  of cognition. Recently, it has been shown how it can be
		  used as a computational primitive in spiking neural
		  networks for constructing complex cognitive behaviors in
		  neuromorphic agents. However, to achieve the desired
		  computations and behaviors in mixed signal analog-digital
		  neuromorphic electronic systems, these computational
		  primitives should be able to cope with noisy and imprecise
		  components, such as silicon neurons and synapses, with
		  noisy and unreliable external signals, and with
		  interference from the environment. Here we present a
		  spiking neural network model that addresses all these
		  issues while exhibiting both analog signal processing
		  properties and digital symbolic computational abilities. We
		  show how this Neural State Machine (NSM) model can be used
		  for realizing robust state-dependent computation on
		  neuromorphic hardware, and we validate it with experimental
		  results obtained from a recently developed multi-neuron
		  multi-core neuromorphic computing architecture.},

		  imager functions over 5 decades of background illumination
		  and has much more symmetrical ON and OFF responses. This
		  imager achieves massive redundancy reduction by temporally
		  differentiating the image contrast. The ideal functions of
		  the pixels are to compute the rectified derivatives /sup
		  d///sub dt/(log I) = (dI/dt)/I, where I is the photocurrent
		  in the pixel. The values of these derivatives are rectified
		  and output as rate-coded events on the AER (address-event
		  representation) bus. The 2.2 mm by 2.2 mm, chip was built
		  in a 0.35 /spl mu/m 4M 2P CMOS process. The pixels are 40
		  /spl mu/m by 40 /spl mu/m and the array has 32 by 32
		  pixels, each with ON and OFF outputs. System power
		  consumption is about 30 mA at 3.3 V.}

abstract	= {This paper describes a 128 times 128 pixel CMOS vision
		  sensor. Each pixel independently and in continuous time
		  quantizes local relative intensity changes to generate
		  spike events. These events appear at the output of the
		  sensor as an asynchronous stream of digital pixel
		  addresses. These address-events signify scene reflectance
		  change and have sub-millisecond timing precision. The
		  output data rate depends on the dynamic content of the
		  scene and is typically orders of magnitude lower than those
		  of conventional frame-based imagers. By combining an active
		  continuous-time front-end logarithmic photoreceptor with a
		  self-timed switched-capacitor differencing circuit, the
		  sensor achieves an array mismatch of 2.1\% in relative
		  intensity event threshold and a pixel bandwidth of 3 kHz
		  under 1 klux scene illumination. Dynamic range is gt; 120
		  dB and chip power consumption is 23 mW. Event latency shows
		  weak light dependency with a minimum of 15 mus at gt; 1
		  klux pixel illumination. The sensor is built in a 0.35 mum
		  4M2P process. It has 40x40 mum{$^2$} pixels with 9.4\% fill
		  factor. By providing high pixel bandwidth, wide dynamic
		  range, and precisely timed sparse digital output, this
		  silicon retina provides an attractive combination of
		  characteristics for low-latency dynamic vision under
		  uncontrolled illumination with low post-processing
		  requirements.}

abstract	= {It has long been speculated that the
		  backpropagation-of-error algorithm (backprop) may be a
		  model of how the brain learns. Backpropagation-through-time
		  (BPTT) is the canonical temporal-analogue to backprop used
		  to assign credit in recurrent neural networks in machine
		  learning, but there's even less conviction about whether
		  BPTT has anything to do with the brain. Even in machine
		  learning the use of BPTT in classic neural network
		  architectures has proven insufficient for some challenging
		  temporal credit assignment (TCA) problems that we know the
		  brain is capable of solving. Nonetheless, recent work in
		  machine learning has made progress in solving difficult TCA
		  problems by employing novel memory-based and
		  attention-based architectures and algorithms, some of which
		  are brain inspired. Importantly, these recent machine
		  learning methods have been developed in the context of, and
		  with reference to BPTT, and thus serve to strengthen BPTT's
		  position as a useful normative guide for thinking about
		  temporal credit assignment in artificial and biological
		  systems alike.}

		  characterized interactions between inputs from the two eyes
		  in disparity-selective neurons in macaque V1. All
		  disparity-selective cells showed suppressive interactions
		  between the right and left eyes, and some showed
		  facilitatory interactions. Disparity selectivity was
		  narrower than the receptive-field width and was constant
		  across the receptive field. Such position-invariant
		  disparity selectivity is also found in anesthetized cat V1.
		  Complex cells have been suggested to inherit their
		  disparity selectivity from simple cells with receptive
		  fields mismatched between the two eyes. However, we found
		  no such antecedent disparity-tuned simple cells. We did
		  find disparity-selective cells with some simple-cell
		  characteristics, but surprisingly, they also showed
		  position-invariant disparity selectivity rather than simple
		  linear binocular interactions.}

		  task that the brain has to solve. The same neurons may be
		  used to produce different sequential behaviours. The way
		  the brain learns and encodes such tasks remains unknown as
		  current computational models do not typically use realistic
		  biologically-plausible learning. Here, we propose a model
		  where a spiking recurrent network of excitatory and
		  inhibitory spiking neurons drives a read-out layer: the
		  dynamics of the driver recurrent network is trained to
		  encode time which is then mapped through the read-out
		  neurons to encode another dimension, such as space or a
		  phase. Different spatiotemporal patterns can be learned and
		  encoded through the synaptic weights to the read-out
		  neurons that follow common Hebbian learning rules. We
		  demonstrate that the model is able to learn spatiotemporal
		  dynamics on time scales that are behaviourally relevant and
		  we show that the learned sequences are robustly replayed
		  during a regime of spontaneous activity.}

		  algorithm in an analog VLSI chip that computes
		  stereocorrespondence from one-dimensional input patterns in

abstract	= {Summary Cortical areas differ in their patterns of
		  connectivity, cellular composition, and functional
		  architecture. Spike trains, on the other hand, are commonly
		  assumed to follow similarly irregular dynamics across
		  neocortex. We examined spike-time statistics in four
		  parietal areas using a method that accounts for
		  nonstationarities in firing rate. We found that, whereas
		  neurons in visual areas fire irregularly, many cells in
		  association and motor-like parietal regions show
		  increasingly regular spike trains by comparison. Regularity
		  was evident both in the shape of interspike interval
		  distributions and in spike-count variability across trials.
		  Thus, Poisson-like randomness is not a universal feature of
		  neocortex. Rather, many parietal cells have reduced
		  trial-to-trial variability in spike counts that could
		  provide for more reliable firing-rate signals. These
		  results suggest that spiking dynamics may play different
		  roles in different cortical areas and should not be assumed
		  to arise from fundamentally irreducible noise sources.}

		  matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1)
		  Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar
		  masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the
		  equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2)
		  Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly
		  correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends
		  of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask
		  orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of
		  zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two
		  images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of
		  the mask's central region. (4) Wide masks can control
		  vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into
		  correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it
		  is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 21/2-D sketch. It
		  is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical
		  framework for most existing psychophysical and
		  neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical
		  experimental predictions are also made, for instance about
		  the size of Panum's area under various conditions. The
		  results of such experiments would tell us whether, for
		  example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching
		  process.}

abstract	= {Our eyes move continually, even while we fixate our gaze
		  on an object. If fixational eye movements are counteracted,
		  our perception of stationary objects fades completely, due
		  to neural adaptation. Some studies have suggested that
		  fixational microsaccades refresh retinal images, thereby
		  preventing adaptation and fading. However, other studies
		  disagree, and so the role of microsaccades remains unclear.
		  Here, we correlate visibility during fixation to the
		  occurrence of microsaccades. We asked subjects to indicate
		  when Troxler fading of a peripheral target occurs, while
		  simultaneously recording their eye movements with high
		  precision. We found that before a fading period, the
		  probability, rate, and magnitude of microsaccades
		  decreased. Before transitions toward visibility, the
		  probability, rate, and magnitude of microsaccades
		  increased. These results reveal a direct link between
		  suppression of microsaccades and fading and suggest a
		  causal relationship between microsaccade production and
		  target visibility during fixation.}

		  Potentiation (LTP) when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly
		  before a postsynaptic neuron, and Long Term Depression
		  (LTD) when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after, a
		  phenomenon known as Spike Timing Dependant Plasticity
		  (STDP). When a neuron is presented successively with
		  discrete volleys of input spikes STDP has been shown to
		  learn 'early spike patterns', that is to concentrate
		  synaptic weights on afferents that consistently fire early,
		  with the result that the postsynaptic spike latency
		  decreases, until it reaches a minimal and stable value.
		  Here, we show that these results still stand in a
		  continuous regime where afferents fire continuously with a
		  constant population rate. As such, STDP is able to solve a
		  very difficult computational problem: to localize a
		  repeating spatio-temporal spike pattern embedded in equally
		  dense 'distractor' spike trains. STDP thus enables some
		  form of temporal coding, even in the absence of an explicit
		  time reference. Given that the mechanism exposed here is
		  simple and cheap it is hard to believe that the brain did
		  not evolve to use it.}

		  states, such as synaptic efficacies endowed with short-term
		  synaptic plasticity. To test this idea computationally, we
		  investigated recurrent neural network models trained to
		  perform several WM-dependent tasks, in which WM
		  representation emerges from learning and is not a priori
		  assumed to depend on self-sustained persistent activity. We
		  found that short-term synaptic plasticity can support the
		  short-term maintenance of information, provided that the
		  memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in
		  tasks that require actively manipulating information,
		  persistent activity naturally emerges from learning, and
		  the amount of persistent activity scales with the degree of
		  manipulation required. These results shed insight into the
		  current debate on WM encoding and suggest that persistent
		  activity can vary markedly between short-term memory tasks
		  with different cognitive demands.},

abstract	= {Abstract Biorealistic spiking neural networks (SNN) are
		  believed to hold promise for further energy improvement
		  over artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, it is
		  difficult to implement SNNs in hardware, in particular the
		  complicated algorithms that ANNs can handle with ease.
		  Thus, it is natural to look for a middle path by combining
		  the advantages of these two types of networks and
		  consolidating them using an {ANN--SNN} converter. A
		  proof-of-concept study of this idea is performed by
		  experimentally demonstrating such a converter using
		  diffusive memristor neurons coupled with a 32x1
		  1-transistor 1-memristor ({1T1R}) synapse array of drift
		  memristors. It is experimentally verified that the weighted
		  sum output of the memristor synapse array can be readily
		  converted into the frequency of oscillation of an
		  oscillatory neuron based on a {SiOxNy:Ag} diffusive
		  memristor. Two converters are then connected capacitively
		  to demonstrate the synchronization capability of this
		  network. The compact oscillatory neuron comprises multiple
		  transistors and has much better scalability than a
		  complimentary metal oxide semiconductor ({CMOS}) integrate
		  and fire neuron. It paves the way for emulating half center
		  oscillators in central pattern generators of the central
		  nervous system.}

abstract	= {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising
		  computational paradigm to emulate the features of natural
		  neural tissue physiology. While hardware implementations of
		  SNNs are being conceived to emulate biological systems,
		  they typically rely on hard and rigid silicon electronics
		  that are not bio-compatible. In the physical, or materials
		  realm, organic electronics offer mechanical flexibility and
		  bio-compatibility, allowing for the construction of neural
		  processing systems that can be directly interfaced to
		  biological networks. This study introduces an organic
		  electronics implementation of an Integrate-and-Fire spiking
		  neuron based on the Axon-Hillock CMOS circuit. The circuit
		  employs organic p-type and n-type field effective
		  transistors and reproduces the behavior of the CMOS
		  neuromorphic counterpart. We demonstrate its operating
		  characteristics measuring its spike rate output as a
		  function of its input current. We show how it properly
		  integrates input currents and demonstrate its computing
		  abilities in a basic current summing experiment. The static
		  and dynamic power dissipation is calculated to be less than
		  0.4 and 40 $\mu$W, respectively. This is the first
		  demonstration of the spiking Axon-Hillock neuromorphic
		  circuit using organic materials.},

abstract	= {We investigated the hypothesis that neurons encode rich
		  naturalistic stimuli in terms of their spike times relative
		  to the phase of ongoing network fluctuations rather than
		  only in terms of their spike count. We recorded local field
		  potentials (LFPs) and multiunit spikes from the primary
		  visual cortex of anaesthetized macaques while binocularly
		  presenting a color movie. We found that both the spike
		  counts and the low-frequency LFP phase were reliably
		  modulated by the movie and thus conveyed information about
		  it. Moreover, movie periods eliciting higher firing rates
		  also elicited a higher reliability of LFP phase across
		  trials. To establish whether the LFP phase at which spikes
		  were emitted conveyed visual information that could not be
		  extracted by spike rates alone, we compared the Shannon
		  information about the movie carried by spike counts to that
		  carried by the phase of firing. We found that at low LFP
		  frequencies, the phase of firing conveyed 54\% additional
		  information beyond that conveyed by spike counts. The extra
		  information available in the phase of firing was crucial
		  for the disambiguation between stimuli eliciting high spike
		  rates of similar magnitude. Thus, phase coding may allow
		  primary cortical neurons to represent several effective
		  stimuli in an easily decodable format.}

abstract	= {When a stimulus supports two distinct interpretations,
		  perception alternates in an irregular manner between them.
		  What causes the bistable perceptual switches remains an
		  open question. Most existing models assume that switches
		  arise from a slow fatiguing process, such as adaptation or
		  synaptic depression. We develop a new, attractor-based
		  framework in which alternations are induced by noise and
		  are absent without it. Our model goes beyond previous
		  energy-based conceptualizations of perceptual bistability
		  by constructing a neurally plausible attractor model that
		  is implemented in both firing rate mean-field and spiking
		  cell-based networks. The model accounts for known
		  properties of bistable perceptual phenomena, most notably
		  the increase in alternation rate with stimulation strength
		  observed in binocular rivalry. Furthermore, it makes a
		  novel prediction about the effect of changing stimulus
		  strength on the activity levels of the dominant and
		  suppressed neural populations, a prediction that could be
		  tested with functional MRI or electrophysiological
		  recordings. The neural architecture derived from the
		  energy-based model readily generalizes to several competing
		  populations, providing a natural extension for
		  multistability phenomena.}

		  study further examines the representations underlying IOR
		  by investigating whether IOR is influenced by
		  action-related properties of objects. An exogenous cue
		  appeared on the side of an object that was either
		  compatible or incompatible with the action afforded by the
		  object. Then a target requiring a rapid key-press or reach
		  localisation response appeared on the cued or uncued side.
		  Responses were slower to cued versus uncued targets, but
		  this IOR effect did not interact with action-compatibility.
		  These results show that IOR does not appear to operate on

abstract	= {In this paper, we outline an architecture for supporting
		  real time autonomous vision in small devices. Our vision
		  processor performs data reduction at the point of image
		  capture, using re-configurable hardware devices to extract
		  and describe image features. By implementing our design on
		  FPGAs, the vision processor can support highly parallel
		  vision processing structures as well as more traditional
		  pipelined or sequential algorithms. Because the processor
		  hardware can be reconfigured, it becomes a flexible
		  prototyping tool. The resulting platform is well suited for
		  research in reactive robot control based on vision, as well
		  as research into biomorphic vision structures.}

		  The promise of decreased latencies, increased computational

		  non-volatile memory (NVM) based
		  In-Memory-Computing(IMC)/Processing-In-Memory (PIM)
		  techniques is not without its caveats. This paper surveys

		  Current and potential methods for reliably programming
		  these devices in a crossbar matrix are discussed, as well

		  matrix products to emulate the well-known MAC-like
		  operations throughout the neural network. This paper
		  complements previous surveys, but most importantly uncovers

		  of analog-based ANN implementations based on

		  neuromorphic hardware. Scalability in computational
		  efficiency, i.e., amount of time spent in actual
		  computation, remains a huge challenge in very large

		  address the scalability in network workloads in finding a
		  globally optimal partition and efficiently mapping onto
		  hardware. As communication is regarded as the most energy
		  and time-consuming part of such distributed processing, the
		  partitioning framework is optimized for compute-balanced,
		  memory-efficient parallel processing targeting low-latency
		  execution and dense synaptic storage, with minimal routing
		  across various compute cores. We demonstrate highly
		  scalable and efficient partitioning for connectivity-aware
		  and hierarchical address-event routing resource-optimized
		  mapping, significantly reducing the total communication
		  volume recursively when compared to random balanced
		  assignment. We showcase our results working on synthetic
		  networks with varying degrees of sparsity factor and
		  fan-out, small-world networks, feed-forward networks, and a
		  hemibrain connectome reconstruction of the fruit-fly brain.
		  The combination of our method and practical results suggest

		  hypothesis is that accurate timing is achieved by purely

		  that the transient dynamics of the system are used to

		  The interaction between both types of dynamics yields

abstract	= {The success of deep networks and recent industry
		  involvement in brain-inspired computing is igniting a
		  widespread interest in neuromorphic hardware that emulates
		  the biological processes of the brain on an electronic
		  substrate. This review explores interdisciplinary
		  approaches anchored in machine learning theory that enable
		  the applicability of neuromorphic technologies to
		  real-world, human-centric tasks. We find that (1) recent
		  work in binary deep networks and approximate gradient
		  descent learning are strikingly compatible with a
		  neuromorphic substrate; (2) where real-time adaptability
		  and autonomy are necessary, neuromorphic technologies can
		  achieve significant advantages over main-stream ones; and
		  (3) challenges in memory technologies, compounded by a
		  tradition of bottom-up approaches in the field, block the
		  road to major breakthroughs. We suggest that a neuromorphic
		  learning framework, tuned specifically for the spatial and
		  temporal constraints of the neuromorphic substrate, will
		  help guiding hardware algorithm co-design and deploying

abstract	= {An ongoing challenge in neuromorphic computing is to
		  devise general and computationally efficient models of
		  inference and learning which are compatible with the
		  spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One
		  increasingly popular and successful approach is to take
		  inspiration from inference and learning algorithms used in
		  deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of deep
		  learning, the gradient descent Back Propagation (BP) rule,
		  often relies on the immediate availability of network-wide
		  information stored with high-precision memory, and precise
		  operations that are difficult to realize with spiking
		  neurons. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact
		  backpropagated weights are not essential for learning deep
		  representations. Random BP replaces feedback weights with
		  random ones and encourages the network to adjust its
		  feed-forward weights to learn pseudo-inverses of the
		  (random) feedback weights. Building on these results, we
		  demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule that uses
		  an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep
		  representations in neuromorphic computing hardware. The
		  rule involves only one addition and two comparisons for
		  each synaptic weight using a two-compartment leaky
		  Integrate & Fire (I&F) neuron, making it very suitable for
		  implementation in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic
		  hardware. Our results show that using eRBP, deep
		  representations are rapidly learned, achieving nearly
		  identical classification accuracies compared to artificial
		  neural network simulations on GPUs, while being robust to
		  neural and synaptic state quantizations during learning.}

		  circuits. One is inspired by the zebra finch and

		  network is motivated by the hippocampus and is trained to
		  store and replay a movie scene. FORCE trained networks

abstract	= {Disparity selectivity in the striate cortex has generally
		  been studied with uniform disparity fields covering the
		  receptive field (RF). In four awake behaving monkeys, we
		  quantitatively characterized the spatial three-dimensional
		  structure of 55 V1 RFs using random dot stereograms in
		  which disparity varied as a sinusoidal function of vertical
		  position ("corrugations"). At low spatial frequencies, this
		  produced a modulation in neuronal firing at the temporal
		  frequency of the stimulus. As the spatial frequency
		  increased, the modulation reduced. The mean response rate
		  changed little and was close to that produced by a uniform
		  stimulus at the mean disparity of the corrugation. In 48 of
		  55 (91\%) neurons, the modulation strength was a lowpass
		  function of spatial frequency. These results are compatible
		  with a response determined only by the weighted mean of the
		  disparities of the dots (the weights being set by the RF
		  envelope) and suggest that there is no disparity-based
		  surround inhibition or selectivity for disparity gradients.
		  This simple weighting scheme predicts a relationship
		  between RF size and the high-frequency cutoff. Comparison
		  with independent measurements of RF size was compatible
		  with this. All of this behavior closely matches the
		  binocular energy model. The mean cutoff frequency, 0.5
		  cycles per degree, is similar to equivalent measures of
		  decline in human psychophysical sensitivity for such depth
		  corrugations as a function of frequency (Tyler, 1974;
		  Prince and Rogers, 1998; Banks et al., 2004). This suggests
		  that human cyclopean acuity for disparity modulations is
		  limited by the selectivity of V1 neurons. This in turn is
		  primarily limited by the RF size, because we find no
		  sensitivity for disparity gradients or other disparity
		  differences within the RFs.}

abstract	= {In controlling animal behavior the nervous system has to
		  perform within the operational limits set by the
		  requirements of each specific behavior. The implications
		  for the corresponding range of suitable network, single
		  neuron, and ion channel properties have remained elusive.
		  In this article we approach the question of how
		  well-constrained properties of neuronal systems may be on
		  the neuronal level. We used large data sets of the activity
		  of isolated invertebrate identified cells and built an
		  accurate conductance-based model for this cell type using
		  customized automated parameter estimation techniques. By
		  direct inspection of the data we found that the variability
		  of the neurons is larger when they are isolated from the
		  circuit than when in the intact system. Furthermore, the
		  responses of the neurons to perturbations appear to be more
		  consistent than their autonomous behavior under stationary
		  conditions. In the developed model, the constraints on
		  different parameters that enforce appropriate model
		  dynamics vary widely from some very tightly controlled
		  parameters to others that are almost arbitrary. The model
		  also allows predictions for the effect of blocking selected
		  ionic currents and to prove that the origin of irregular
		  dynamics in the neuron model is proper chaoticity and that
		  this chaoticity is typical in an appropriate sense. Our
		  results indicate that data driven models are useful tools
		  for the in-depth analysis of neuronal dynamics. The better
		  consistency of responses to perturbations, in the real
		  neurons as well as in the model, suggests a paradigm shift
		  away from measuring autonomous dynamics alone towards
		  protocols of controlled perturbations. Our predictions for
		  the impact of channel blockers on the neuronal dynamics and
		  the proof of chaoticity underscore the wide scope of our
		  approach.}

abstract	= {We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical
		  neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is
		  functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may
		  have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of
		  adjustments that center a limited response range around a
		  mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we
		  measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate
		  cortex while systematically adapting them to different
		  contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of
		  cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic
		  experiment show that contrast-response functions shift
		  laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response
		  functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This
		  implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the
		  cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this
		  process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this
		  contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to
		  cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type
		  (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain
		  control is almost certainly a cortical function, since
		  lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal
		  effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37)
		  provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the
		  process. In another series of experiments, the effect of
		  contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast
		  sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast
		  levels as low as 3\% was capable of nearly doubling the
		  thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may
		  therefore be an important factor in determinations of the
		  contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the
		  spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these
		  gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using
		  both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that
		  portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory
		  discharges could be elicited directly (the central
		  discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive
		  property of the central region. This held even in the case
		  of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences
		  from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we
		  measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found
		  the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of
		  approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable
		  variability in this value from cell to cell.}

		  Encoding of binocular disparity by complex cells in the

		  To examine the roles that complex cells play in stereopsis,
		  we have recorded extracellularly from isolated single
		  neurons in the striate cortex of anesthetized paralyzed
		  cats. We measured binocular responses of complex cells
		  using a comprehensive stimulus set that encompasses all
		  possible combinations of positions over the receptive
		  fields for the two eyes. For a given position combination,
		  stimulus contrast could be the same for the two eyes (2
		  bright or 2 dark bars) or opposite (1 bright and 1 dark).
		  These measurements provide a binocular receptive field (RF)
		  profile that completely characterizes complex cell
		  responses in a joint domain of left and right stimulus
		  positions. Complex cells typically exhibit a strong
		  selectivity for binocular disparity, but are only broadly
		  selective for stimulus position. For most cells,
		  selectivity for disparity is more than twice as narrow as
		  that for position. These characteristics are highly
		  desirable if we assume that a disparity sensor should
		  exhibit position invariance while encoding small changes in
		  stimulus depth. Complex cells have nearly identical
		  binocular RFs for bright and dark stimuli as long as the
		  sign of stimulus contrast is the same for the two eyes.
		  When stimulus contrast is opposite, the binocular RF also
		  is inverted such that excitatory subregions become
		  suppressive. We have developed a disparity energy model
		  that accounts for the behavior of disparity-sensitive
		  complex cells. This is a hierarchical model that
		  incorporates specific constraints on the selection of
		  simple cells from which a complex cell receives input.
		  Experimental data are used to examine quantitatively
		  predictions of the model. Responses of complex cells
		  generally agree well with predictions of the disparity
		  energy model. However, various types of deviations from the
		  predictions also are found, including a highly elongated
		  excitatory region beyond that supported by a single energy
		  mechanism. Complex cells in the visual cortex appear to
		  provide a next level of abstraction in encoding information
		  for stereopsis based on the activity of a group of
		  simple-type subunits. In addition to exhibiting narrow
		  disparity tuning and position invariance, these cells seem
		  to provide a partial solution to the stereo correspondence
		  problem that arises in complex natural scenes. Based on
		  their binocular response properties, these cells provide a
		  substantial reduction in the complexity of the
		  correspondence problem.}

		  Here we show that shared neural mechanisms underlie the

		  prefrontal cortex acts as a domain-general controller. By
		  contrast, both attention and selection were represented
		  independently in parietal and visual cortex. Both selection
		  and attention facilitated behaviour by enhancing and
		  transforming the representation of the selected memory or
		  attended stimulus. Specifically, during the selection task,
		  memory items were initially represented in independent
		  subspaces of neural activity in prefrontal cortex.
		  Selecting an item caused its representation to transform
		  from its own subspace to a new subspace used to guide
		  behaviour. A similar transformation occurred for attention.
		  Our results suggest that prefrontal cortex controls
		  cognition by dynamically transforming representations to
		  control what and when cognitive computations are engaged.},

abstract	= {The field of neuromorphic silicon synapse circuits is
		  revisited and a parsimonious mathematical framework able to
		  describe the dynamics of this class of log-domain circuits
		  in the aggregate and in a systematic manner is proposed.
		  Starting from the Bernoulli Cell Formalism (BCF),
		  originally formulated for the modular synthesis and
		  analysis of externally linear, time-invariant logarithmic
		  filters, and by means of the identification of new types of
		  Bernoulli Cell (BC) operators presented here, a generalised
		  formalism (GBCF) is established. The expanded formalism
		  covers two new possible and practical combinations of a MOS
		  transistor (MOST) and a linear capacitor. The corresponding
		  mathematical relations codifying each case are presented
		  and discussed through the tutorial treatment of three
		  well-known transistor-level examples of log-domain
		  neuromorphic silicon synapses. The proposed mathematical
		  tool unifies past analysis approaches of the same circuits
		  under a common theoretical framework. The speed advantage
		  of the proposed mathematical framework as an analysis tool
		  is also demonstrated by a compelling comparative circuit
		  analysis example of high order, where the GBCF and another
		  well-known log-domain circuit analysis method are used for
		  the determination of the input-output transfer function of
		  the high ({$4^{th}$}) order topology.}

		  participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex
		  natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of
		  attention, as measured by the correlation between computed
		  stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be
		  significantly greater than that expected by chance alone
		  and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that
		  immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide
		  attention of three modeled stimulus features (color,
		  intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary
		  with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in
		  visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on
		  stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an
		  important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall,
		  the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up
		  mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance

		  depends on pre and postsynaptic activity. However, models
		  that rely solely on pre and postsynaptic activity for
		  synaptic changes have, to date, not been able to account
		  for learning complex tasks that demand hierarchical
		  networks. Here, we show that if synaptic plasticity is
		  regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then neurons
		  higher in the hierarchy can coordinate the plasticity of
		  lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical
		  analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term
		  synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical
		  dendrites, and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a
		  burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks
		  that require deep network architectures. Our results
		  demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites,
		  synapses, and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable
		  sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits.},

		  blocks dc and low-frequency input drift at about 1 Hz. The

		  The SPK and LFP channels provide variable amplification
		  rates of up to 5000 and 500, respectively. The analog
		  signals are converted into 10-bit digital form, and
		  streamed out over a serial digital bus at up to 8 Mbps. A
		  threshold filter suppresses inactive portions of the signal
		  and emits only spike segments of programmable length. A

		  2002. Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of
		  overt visual attention. Vision Research 42 (1) (2002)
		  107-123] showed that a model of bottom-up visual attention
		  can account in part for the spatial locations fixated by
		  humans while free-viewing complex natural and artificial
		  scenes. That study used a definition of salience based on
		  local detectors with coarse global surround inhibition.
		  Here, we use a similar framework to investigate the roles
		  of several types of non-linear interactions known to exist
		  in visual cortex, and of eccentricity-dependent processing.
		  For each of these, we added a component to the salience
		  model, including richer interactions among orientation-
		  tuned units, both at spatial short range (for clutter
		  reduction) and long range (for contour facilitation), and a
		  detailed model of eccentricity-dependent changes in visual
		  processing. Subjects free-viewed naturalistic and
		  artificial images while their eye movements were recorded,
		  and the resulting fixation locations were compared with the
		  models' predicted salience maps. We found that the proposed
		  interactions indeed play a significant role in the
		  spatiotemporal deployment of attention in natural scenes;
		  about half of the observed inter-subject variance can be
		  explained by these different models. This suggests that
		  attentional guidance does not depend solely on local visual
		  features, but must also include the effects of interactions
		  among features. As models of these interactions become more
		  accurate in predicting behaviorally-relevant salient
		  locations, they become useful to a range of applications in
		  computer vision and human-machine interface design.}

abstract	= {This paper presents an adaptive cooperative approach
		  towards the 3D reconstruction tailored for a bio-inspired
		  depth camera: the stereo dynamic vision sensor (DVS). DVS
		  consists of self-spiking pixels that asynchronously
		  generate events upon relative light intensity changes.
		  These sensors have the advantage to allow simultaneously
		  high temporal resolution (better than 10$\mu$s) and wide
		  dynamic range ({\textgreater}120dB) at sparse data
		  representation, which is not possible with frame-based
		  cameras. In order to exploit the potential of DVS and
		  benefit from its features, depth calculation should take
		  into account the spatiotemporal and asynchronous aspect of
		  data provided by the sensor. This work deals with
		  developing an appropriate approach for the asynchronous,
		  event-driven stereo algorithm. We propose a modification of
		  the cooperative network in which the history of the recent
		  activity in the scene is stored to serve as spatiotemporal
		  context used in disparity calculation for each incoming
		  event. The network constantly evolves in time - as events
		  are generated. In our work, not only the spatiotemporal
		  aspect of the data is preserved but also the matching is
		  performed asynchronously. The results of the experiments
		  prove that the proposed approach is well suited for DVS
		  data and can be successfully used for our efficient passive
		  depth camera.}

abstract	= {Mammalian spatial navigation systems utilize several
		  different sensory information channels. This information is
		  converted into a neural code that represents the animal's
		  current position in space by engaging place cell, grid
		  cell, and head direction cell networks. In particular,
		  sensory landmark (allothetic) cues can be utilized in
		  concert with an animal's knowledge of its own velocity
		  (idiothetic) cues to generate a more accurate
		  representation of position than path integration provides
		  on its own (Battaglia et al. The Journal of Neuroscience
		  24(19):4541--4550 (2004)). We develop a computational model
		  that merges path integration with feedback from external
		  sensory cues that provide a reliable representation of
		  spatial position along an annular track. Starting with a
		  continuous bump attractor model, we explore the impact of
		  synaptic spatial asymmetry and heterogeneity, which disrupt
		  the position code of the path integration process. We use
		  asymptotic analysis to reduce the bump attractor model to a
		  single scalar equation whose potential represents the
		  impact of asymmetry and heterogeneity. Such imperfections
		  cause errors to build up when the network performs path
		  integration, but these errors can be corrected by an
		  external control signal representing the effects of sensory
		  cues. We demonstrate that there is an optimal strength and
		  decay rate of the control signal when cues appear either
		  periodically or randomly. A similar analysis is performed
		  when errors in path integration arise from dynamic noise
		  fluctuations. Again, there is an optimal strength and decay
		  of discrete control that minimizes the path integration
		  error.},

abstract	= {Visual search is a fundamental and routine task of
		  everyday life. Studying visual search promises to shed
		  light on the basic attentional mechanisms that facilitate
		  visual processing. To investigate visual attention during
		  search processes, numerous studies measured the selectivity
		  of observers' saccadic eye movements for local display
		  features. These experiments almost entirely relied on
		  simple, artificial displays with discrete search items and
		  features. The present study employed complex search
		  displays and targets to examine task-driven (top-down)
		  visual guidance by low-level features under more natural
		  conditions. Significant guidance by local intensity,
		  contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation was found, and
		  its properties such as magnitude and resolution were
		  analyzed across dimensions. Moreover, feature-ratio effects
		  were detected, which correspond to distractor-ratio effects
		  in simple search displays. These results point out the
		  limitations of current purely stimulus-driven (bottom-up)
		  models of attention during scene perception.}

		  The mechanisms that lead to fast adaptations and their
		  interaction with action valuation are a central issue. We
		  show here that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes
		  multiple feedbacks devoted to exploration and its immediate
		  termination. In a task that alternates exploration and
		  exploitation periods, the ACC monitored negative and
		  positive outcomes relevant for different adaptations. In
		  particular, it produced signals specific of the first
		  reward, i.e., the end of exploration. Those signals
		  disappeared in exploitation periods but immediately
		  transferred to the initiation of trials-a transfer
		  comparable to learning phenomena observed for dopaminergic
		  neurons. Importantly, these were also observed for high
		  gamma oscillations of local field potentials shown to
		  correlate with brain imaging signal. Thus, mechanisms of
		  action valuation and monitoring of events/actions are
		  combined for rapid behavioral regulation.},

		  network activity during a variety of behaviors, including
		  working memory and decision making. Previous network models
		  for sequences and memory emphasized specialized
		  architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired
		  into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting
		  from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of
		  connections, a largely disordered recurrent network can
		  produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently.
		  We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training
		  (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging
		  data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual
		  memory-guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis
		  of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the
		  cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and
		  external inputs, rather than through feedforward or
		  asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that
		  neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely
		  unstructured network architectures.},

		  trains solely on the basis of the underlying local field
		  potentials (LFPs). Using support vector machines and linear
		  regression models, we found that in the primary visual
		  cortex (V1) of monkeys, spikes can indeed be inferred from
		  LFPs, at least with moderate success. Although there is a
		  considerable degree of variation across electrodes, the
		  low-frequency structure in spike trains (in the 100-ms
		  range) can be inferred with reasonable accuracy, whereas
		  exact spike positions are not reliably predicted. Two kinds
		  of features of the LFP are exploited for prediction: the
		  frequency power of bands in the high {gamma}-range (40-90
		  Hz) and information contained in low-frequency oscillations
		  (<10 Hz), where both phase and power modulations are
		  informative. Information analysis revealed that both
		  features code (mainly) independent aspects of the
		  spike-to-LFP relationship, with the low-frequency LFP phase
		  coding for temporally clustered spiking activity. Although
		  both features and prediction quality are similar during
		  seminatural movie stimuli and spontaneous activity,
		  prediction performance during spontaneous activity degrades
		  much more slowly with increasing electrode distance. The
		  general trend of data obtained with anesthetized animals is
		  qualitatively mirrored in that of a more limited data set
		  recorded in V1 of non-anesthetized monkeys. In contrast to
		  the cortical field potentials, thalamic LFPs (e.g., LFPs
		  derived from recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate
		  nucleus) hold no useful information for predicting spiking
		  activity.}

abstract	= {One of the fundamental challenges of binocular vision is
		  that objects project to different positions on the two
		  retinas (binocular disparity). Neurons in visual cortex
		  show two distinct types of tuning to disparity, position
		  and phase disparity, which are the results of differences
		  in receptive field location and profile, respectively.
		  Here, we point out that phase disparity does not occur in
		  natural images. Why, then, should the brain encode it? We
		  propose that phase-disparity detectors help to work out
		  which feature in the left eye corresponds to a given
		  feature in the right. This correspondence problem is
		  plagued by false matches: regions of the image that look
		  similar, but do not correspond to the same object. We show
		  that phase-disparity neurons tend to be more strongly
		  activated by false matches. Thus, they may act as 'lie
		  detectors', enabling the true correspondence to be deduced
		  by a process of elimination.}

		  successes in solving sequential processing and planning
		  tasks. Their success is often ascribed to the emergence of
		  the task's low-dimensional latent structure in the network
		  activity -- i.e., in the learned neural representations.
		  Here, we investigate the hypothesis that a means for
		  generating representations with easily accessed
		  low-dimensional latent structure, possibly reflecting an
		  underlying semantic organization, is through learning to
		  predict observations about the world. Specifically, we ask
		  whether and when network mechanisms for sensory prediction
		  coincide with those for extracting the underlying latent
		  variables. Using a recurrent neural network model trained
		  to predict a sequence of observations we show that network
		  dynamics exhibit low-dimensional but nonlinearly
		  transformed representations of sensory inputs that map the
		  latent structure of the sensory environment. We quantify
		  these results using nonlinear measures of intrinsic
		  dimensionality and linear decodability of latent variables,
		  and provide mathematical arguments for why such useful
		  predictive representations emerge. We focus throughout on
		  how our results can aid the analysis and interpretation of
		  experimental data.},

		  high level information from a variety of sensors is in
		  increasingly high demand. This is due to the increasing
		  number of smart devices that require sensory processing for
		  their application on the edge. To tackle this problem, we
		  present a smart vision sensor System on Chip (Soc),
		  featuring an event-based camera and a low power
		  asynchronous spiking Convolutional Neuronal Network (sCNN)
		  computing architecture embedded on a single chip. By
		  combining both sensor and processing on a single die, we
		  can lower unit production costs significantly. Moreover,
		  the simple end-to-end nature of the SoC facilitates small
		  stand-alone applications as well as functioning as an edge
		  node in a larger systems. The event-driven nature of the
		  vision sensor delivers high-speed signals in a sparse data
		  stream. This is reflected in the processing pipeline,
		  focuses on optimising highly sparse computation and
		  minimising latency for 9 sCNN layers to \$3.36μs\$.
		  Overall, this results in an extremely low-latency visual
		  processing pipeline deployed on a small form factor with a
		  low energy budget and sensor cost. We present the
		  asynchronous architecture, the individual blocks, the sCNN
		  processing principle and benchmark against other sCNN
		  capable processors.}

		  encoding the task rules are represented by stable patterns
		  of neural activity (attractors of the neural dynamics), the
		  neurons must be selective for combinations of sensory
		  stimuli and inner mental states. Such mixed selectivity is
		  easily obtained by neurons that connect with random
		  synaptic strengths both to the recurrent network and to
		  neurons encoding sensory inputs. The number of randomly
		  connected neurons needed to solve a task is on average only
		  three times as large as the number of neurons needed in a
		  network designed ad hoc. Moreover, the number of needed
		  neurons grows only linearly with the number of
		  task-relevant events and mental states, provided that each
		  neuron responds to a large proportion of events
		  (dense/distributed coding). A biologically realistic
		  implementation of the model captures several aspects of the
		  activity recorded from monkeys performing context dependent
		  tasks. Our findings explain the importance of the diversity
		  of neural responses and provide us with simple and general
		  principles for designing attractor neural networks that
		  perform complex computation.}

abstract	= {BACKGROUND:We consider the problem of parameter estimation
		  (model calibration) in nonlinear dynamic models of
		  biological systems. Due to the frequent ill-conditioning
		  and multi-modality of many of these problems, traditional
		  local methods usually fail (unless initialized with very
		  good guesses of the parameter vector). In order to surmount
		  these difficulties, global optimization (GO) methods have
		  been suggested as robust alternatives. Currently,
		  deterministic GO methods can not solve problems of
		  realistic size within this class in reasonable computation
		  times. In contrast, certain types of stochastic GO methods
		  have shown promising results, although the computational
		  cost remains large. Rodriguez-Fernandez and coworkers have
		  presented hybrid stochastic-deterministic GO methods which
		  could reduce computation time by one order of magnitude
		  while guaranteeing robustness. Our goal here was to further
		  reduce the computational effort without loosing
		  robustness.RESULTS:We have developed a new procedure based
		  on the scatter search methodology for nonlinear
		  optimization of dynamic models of arbitrary (or even
		  unknown) structure (i.e. black-box models). In this
		  contribution, we describe and apply this novel
		  metaheuristic, inspired by recent developments in the field
		  of operations research, to a set of complex identification
		  problems and we make a critical comparison with respect to
		  the previous (above mentioned) successful
		  methods.CONCLUSION:Robust and efficient methods for
		  parameter estimation are of key importance in systems
		  biology and related areas. The new metaheuristic presented
		  in this paper aims to ensure the proper solution of these
		  problems by adopting a global optimization approach, while
		  keeping the computational effort under reasonable values.
		  This new metaheuristic was applied to a set of three
		  challenging parameter estimation problems of nonlinear
		  dynamic biological systems, outperforming very
		  significantly all the methods previously used for these
		  benchmark problems.},

		  Furthermore, as the relative contrast of the gratings was
		  varied, perceived depth varied smoothly in the direction of

abstract	= {We frequently reposition our gaze by making rapid
		  ballistic eye movements that are called saccades. Saccades
		  pose problems for the visual system, because they generate
		  rapid, large-field motion on the retina and change the
		  relationship between the object position in external space
		  and the image position on the retina. The brain must ignore
		  the one and compensate for the other. Much progress has
		  been made in recent years in understanding the effects of
		  saccades on visual function and elucidating the mechanisms
		  responsible for them. Evidence suggests that saccades
		  trigger two distinct neural processes: (1) a suppression of
		  visual sensitivity, specific to the magnocellular pathway,
		  that dampens the sensation of motion and (2) a gross
		  perceptual distortion of visual space in anticipation of
		  the repositioning of gaze. Neurophysiological findings from
		  several laboratories are beginning to identify the neural
		  substrates involved in these effects.}

abstract	= {We hypothesized that learning-induced representational
		  expansion in the primary auditory cortex (AI) directly
		  encodes the degree of behavioral importance of a sound.
		  Rats trained on an operant auditory conditioning task were
		  variably motivated to the conditioned stimulus (CS) through
		  different levels of water deprivation. Mean performance
		  values correlated with deprivation level, validating them
		  as a measure of the overall control and, therefore,
		  behavioral importance of the CS. Electrophysiological
		  mapping revealed expanded representations of the CS,
		  compared with other frequencies in experimental subjects,
		  but not in naive or visually trained controls that received
		  noncontingent CS tones. Importantly, representational area
		  showed a significant positive correlation with mean
		  performance levels for only the CS band, with significant
		  effects for relative area in contrast to only modest
		  changes in absolute area. CS representational expansion was
		  asymmetric into high-frequency zones, thus performance
		  level also was significantly correlated with the relative
		  anterior-posterior location of the enlarged representation.
		  An increased representation of low frequencies, related to
		  the acoustic spectrum of the reward delivery equipment,
		  also was discovered in both experimental and control
		  trained subjects, supporting the conclusion that
		  behaviorally important sounds gain representational area.
		  Furthermore, there was a surprising reduction in total AI
		  area for the experimental and control groups, compared with
		  untrained naive subjects, indicating that the functional
		  dimensions of AI are not fixed. Overall, the findings
		  support the encoding of acquired stimulus importance based
		  on representational size in AI.}

abstract	= {Relational reasoning is a central component of generally
		  intelligent behavior, but has proven difficult for neural
		  networks to learn. In this paper we describe how to use
		  Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to
		  solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational
		  reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks:
		  visual question answering using a challenging dataset
		  called CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art,
		  super-human performance; text-based question answering
		  using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about
		  dynamic physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset
		  called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional
		  networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational
		  questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with
		  RNs. Thus, by simply augmenting convolutions, LSTMs, and
		  MLPs with RNs, we can remove computational burden from
		  network components that are not well-suited to handle
		  relational reasoning, reduce overall network complexity,
		  and gain a general ability to reason about the relations
		  between entities and their properties.},

abstract	= {In the last decade dendrites of cortical neurons have been
		  shown to nonlinearly combine synaptic inputs by evoking
		  local dendritic spikes. It has been suggested that these
		  nonlinearities raise the computational power of a single
		  neuron, making it comparable to a 2-layer network of point
		  neurons. But how these nonlinearities can be incorporated
		  into the synaptic plasticity to optimally support learning
		  remains unclear. We present a theoretically derived
		  synaptic plasticity rule for supervised and reinforcement
		  learning that depends on the timing of the presynaptic, the
		  dendritic and the postsynaptic spikes. For supervised
		  learning, the rule can be seen as a biological version of
		  the classical error-backpropagation algorithm applied to
		  the dendritic case. When modulated by a delayed reward
		  signal, the same plasticity is shown to maximize the
		  expected reward in reinforcement learning for various
		  coding scenarios. Our framework makes specific experimental
		  predictions and highlights the unique advantage of active
		  dendrites for implementing powerful synaptic plasticity
		  rules that have access to downstream information via
		  backpropagation of action potentials.},

abstract	= {Computational neuroscience has uncovered a number of
		  computational principles used by nervous systems. At the
		  same time, neuromorphic hardware has matured to a state
		  where fast silicon implementations of complex neural
		  networks have become feasible. En route to future technical
		  applications of neuromorphic computing the current
		  challenge lies in the identification and implementation of
		  functional brain algorithms. Taking inspiration from the
		  olfactory system of insects, we constructed a spiking
		  neural network for the classification of multivariate data,
		  a common problem in signal and data analysis. In this
		  model, real-valued multivariate data are converted into
		  spike trains using "virtual receptors" (VRs). Their output
		  is processed by lateral inhibition and drives a
		  winner-take-all circuit that supports supervised learning.
		  VRs are conveniently implemented in software, whereas the
		  lateral inhibition and classification stages run on
		  accelerated neuromorphic hardware. When trained and tested
		  on real-world datasets, we find that the classification
		  performance is on par with a naive Bayes classifier. An
		  analysis of the network dynamics shows that stable
		  decisions in output neuron populations are reached within
		  less than 100 ms of biological time, matching the
		  time-to-decision reported for the insect nervous system.
		  Through leveraging a population code, the network tolerates
		  the variability of neuronal transfer functions and
		  trial-to-trial variation that is inevitably present on the
		  hardware system. Our work provides a proof of principle for
		  the successful implementation of a functional spiking
		  neural network on a configurable neuromorphic hardware
		  system that can readily be applied to real-world computing
		  problems.},

		  the key challenges for Redox based resistive switching
		  memory technology. In this paper, we investigate the impact
		  of a serial resistor as a voltage divider on the SET
		  variability in Pt/Ta2O5/Ta/Pt nano crossbar devices. A

		  impact on switching voltages of both modes which allows for

		  the pervasive von Neumann computer architecture. This
		  biologically inspired approach has created highly connected

		  provide a comprehensive survey of the research and

		  begin with a 35-year review of the motivations and drivers
		  of neuromorphic computing, then look at the major research

		  role in network computation is less clear. Most models of
		  computation by neural networks are based on population
		  firing rates. In equivalent spiking implementations, firing
		  is assumed to be random such that averaging across
		  populations of neurons recovers the rate-based approach.
		  Recently, however, Den\'eve and colleagues have suggested
		  that the spiking behavior of neurons may be fundamental to
		  how neuronal networks compute, with precise spike timing
		  determined by each neuron's contribution to producing the
		  desired output (Boerlin and Den\'eve, 2011; Boerlin et al.,
		  2013). By postulating that each neuron fires to reduce the
		  error in the network's output, it was demonstrated that
		  linear computations can be performed by networks of
		  integrate-and-fire neurons that communicate through
		  instantaneous synapses. This left open, however, the
		  possibility that realistic networks, with conductance-based
		  neurons with subthreshold nonlinearity and the slower
		  timescales of biophysical synapses, may not fit into this
		  framework. Here, we show how the spike-based approach can
		  be extended to biophysically plausible networks. We then
		  show that our network reproduces a number of key features
		  of cortical networks including irregular and Poisson-like
		  spike times and a tight balance between excitation and
		  inhibition. Lastly, we discuss how the behavior of our
		  model scales with network size or with the number of
		  neurons "recorded" from a larger computing network. These
		  results significantly increase the biological plausibility
		  of the spike-based approach to network computation.},

abstract	= {Learning in a neuronal network is often thought of as a
		  linear superposition of synaptic modifications induced by
		  individual stimuli. However, since biological synapses are
		  naturally bounded, a linear superposition would cause fast
		  forgetting of previously acquired memories. Here we show
		  that this forgetting can be avoided by introducing
		  additional constraints on the synaptic and neural dynamics.
		  We consider Hebbian plasticity of excitatory synapses. A
		  synapse is modified only if the postsynaptic response does
		  not match the desired output. With this learning rule, the
		  original memory performances with unbounded weights are
		  regained, provided that (1) there is some global
		  inhibition, (2) the learning rate is small, and (3) the
		  neurons can discriminate small differences in the total
		  synaptic input (e.g., by making the neuronal threshold
		  small compared to the total postsynaptic input). We prove
		  in the form of a generalized perceptron convergence theorem
		  that under these constraints, a neuron learns to classify
		  any linearly separable set of patterns, including a wide
		  class of highly correlated random patterns. During the
		  learning process, excitation becomes roughly balanced by
		  inhibition, and the neuron classifies the patterns on the
		  basis of small differences around this balance. The fact
		  that synapses saturate has the additional benefit that
		  nonlinearly separable patterns, such as similar patterns
		  with contradicting outputs, eventually generate a
		  subthreshold response, and therefore silence neurons that
		  cannot provide any information.}

abstract	= {This article reports on two databases for event-driven
		  object recognition using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The
		  first, which we call Poker-DVS and is being released
		  together with this article, was obtained by browsing
		  specially made poker card decks in front of a DVS camera
		  for 2-4 s. Each card appeared on the screen for about 20-30
		  ms. The poker pips were tracked and isolated off-line to
		  constitute the 131-recording Poker-DVS database. The second
		  database, which we call MNIST-DVS and which was released in
		  December 2013, consists of a set of 30,000 DVS camera
		  recordings obtained by displaying 10,000 moving symbols
		  from the standard MNIST 70,000-picture database on an LCD
		  monitor for about 2-3 s each. Each of the 10,000 symbols
		  was displayed at three different scales, so that
		  event-driven object recognition algorithms could easily be
		  tested for different object sizes. This article tells the
		  story behind both databases, covering, among other aspects,
		  details of how they work and the reasons for their
		  creation. We provide not only the databases with
		  corresponding scripts, but also the scripts and data used
		  to generate the figures shown in this article (as
		  Supplementary Material).}

abstract	= {In this paper we review several ways of realizing
		  asynchronous Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) using
		  memristors as synapses. Our focus is on how to use
		  individual memristors to implement synaptic weight
		  multiplications, in a way such that it is not necessary to
		  (a) introduce global synchronization and (b) to separate
		  memristor learning phases from memristor performing phases.
		  In the approaches described, neurons fire spikes
		  asynchronously when they wish and memristive synapses
		  perform computation and learn at their own pace, as it
		  happens in biological neural systems. We distinguish
		  between two different memristor physics, depending on
		  whether they respond to the original ``moving wall'' or to
		  the ``filament creation and annihilation'' models.
		  Independent of the memristor physics, we discuss two
		  different types of STDP rules that can be implemented with
		  memristors: either the pure timing-based rule that takes
		  into account the arrival time of the spikes from the pre-
		  and the post-synaptic neurons, or a hybrid rule that takes
		  into account only the timing of pre-synaptic spikes and the
		  membrane potential and other state variables of the
		  post-synaptic neuron. We show how to implement these rules
		  in cross-bar architectures that comprise massive arrays of
		  memristors, and we discuss applications for artificial
		  vision.}

abstract	= {Predictive coding theories of sensory brain function
		  interpret the hierarchical construction of the cerebral
		  cortex as a Bayesian, generative model capable of
		  predicting the sensory data consistent with any given
		  percept. Predictions are fed backward in the hierarchy and
		  reciprocated by prediction error in the forward direction,
		  acting to modify the representation of the outside world at
		  increasing levels of abstraction, and so to optimize the
		  nature of perception over a series of iterations. This
		  accounts for many 'illusory' instances of perception where
		  what is seen (heard, etc.) is unduly influenced by what is
		  expected, based on past experience. This simple conception,
		  the hierarchical exchange of prediction and prediction
		  error, confronts a rich cortical microcircuitry that is yet
		  to be fully documented. This article presents the view
		  that, in the current state of theory and practice, it is
		  profitable to begin a two-way exchange: that predictive
		  coding theory can support an understanding of cortical
		  microcircuit function, and prompt particular aspects of
		  future investigation, whilst existing knowledge of
		  microcircuitry can, in return, influence theoretical
		  development. As an example, a neural inference arising from
		  the earliest formulations of predictive coding is that the
		  source populations of forward and backward pathways should
		  be completely separate, given their functional distinction;
		  this aspect of circuitry - that neurons with extrinsically
		  bifurcating axons do not project in both directions - has
		  only recently been confirmed. Here, the computational
		  architecture prescribed by a generalized (free-energy)
		  formulation of predictive coding is combined with the
		  classic 'canonical microcircuit' and the laminar
		  architecture of hierarchical extrinsic connectivity to
		  produce a template schematic, that is further examined in
		  the light of (a) updates in the microcircuitry of primate
		  visual cortex, and (b) rapid technical advances made
		  possible by transgenic neural engineering in the mouse. The
		  exercise highlights a number of recurring themes, amongst
		  them the consideration of interneuron diversity as a spur
		  to theoretical development and the potential for specifying
		  a pyramidal neuron's function by its individual
		  'connectome,' combining its extrinsic projection (forward,
		  backward or subcortical) with evaluation of its intrinsic
		  network (e.g., unidirectional versus bidirectional
		  connections with other pyramidal neurons).},

abstract	= {Unidirectional connections from the cortex to the matrix
		  of the corpus striatum initiate the cortico-basal ganglia
		  (BG)-thalamocortical loop, thought to be important in
		  momentary action selection and in longer-term fine tuning
		  of behavioural repertoire; a discrete set of striatal
		  compartments, striosomes, has the complementary role of
		  registering or anticipating reward that shapes
		  corticostriatal plasticity. Re-entrant signals traversing
		  the cortico-BG loop impact predominantly frontal cortices,
		  conveyed through topographically ordered output channels;
		  by contrast, striatal input signals originate from a far
		  broader span of cortex, and are far more divergent in their
		  termination. The term 'disclosed loop' is introduced to
		  describe this organisation: a closed circuit that is open
		  to outside influence at the initial stage of cortical
		  input. The closed circuit component of corticostriatal
		  afferents is newly dubbed 'operative', as it is proposed to
		  establish the bid for action selection on the part of an
		  incipient cortical action plan; the broader set of
		  converging corticostriatal afferents is described as
		  contextual. A corollary of this proposal is that every unit
		  of the striatal volume, including the long, C-shaped tail
		  of the caudate nucleus, should receive a mandatory
		  component of operative input, and hence include at least
		  one area of BG-recipient cortex amongst the sources of its
		  corticostriatal afferents. Individual operative afferents
		  contact twin classes of GABAergic striatal projection
		  neuron (SPN), distinguished by their neurochemical
		  character, and onward circuitry. This is the basis of the
		  classic direct and indirect pathway model of the cortico-BG
		  loop. Each pathway utilises a serial chain of inhibition,
		  with two such links, or three, providing positive and
		  negative feedback, respectively. Operative co-activation of
		  direct and indirect SPNs is, therefore, pictured to
		  simultaneously promote action, and to restrain it. The
		  balance of this rival activity is determined by the
		  contextual inputs, which summarise the external and
		  internal sensory environment, and the state of ongoing
		  behavioural priorities. Notably, the distributed sources of
		  contextual convergence upon a striatal locus mirror the
		  transcortical network harnessed by the origin of the
		  operative input to that locus, thereby capturing a similar
		  set of contingencies relevant to determining action. The
		  disclosed loop formulation of corticostriatal and
		  subsequent BG loop circuitry, as advanced here, refines the
		  operating rationale of the classic model and allows the
		  integration of more recent anatomical and physiological
		  data, some of which can appear at variance with the classic
		  model. Equally, it provides a lucid functional context for
		  continuing cellular studies of SPN biophysics and
		  mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.},

		  various theories of stereo matching, along with spatial
		  scale interactions operating from coarse-to-fine spatial
		  scales. We concentrate here on the role of fine scale
		  information in the stereo matching process and show that
		  fine scale information is capable of disambiguating matches
		  made at coarser scales. An ambiguous coarse scale stimulus
		  was created by presenting a low frequency (2 c/deg) sine
		  wave in anti-phase to the two eyes, whose endpoints
		  betrayed no information about which way the sine waves
		  should be matched. It could be seen with crossed or
		  uncrossed disparity equally validly and at chance from
		  trial to trial. To this was added a fine scale (8 c/deg)
		  filtered random dot stimulus specifying unambiguously a
		  certain disparity. Observers judged the apparent depth of
		  the two stimuli as the disparity of the fine scale stimulus
		  was varied. The sine wave was usually perceived to have the
		  same sign disparity as the fine scale stimulus. Depth
		  matching with the two superimposed stimuli confirmed that
		  the coarse scale stimulus was actually disambiguated, and
		  seen with disparities equal to half its spatial period. The
		  results suggest the operation of a cross-spatial scale
		  matching disambiguation process, which can operate in a
		  fine-to-coarse fashion.}

abstract	= {{In experiments designed to uncover the neural basis of
		  adaptive decision making in a foraging environment,
		  neuroscientists have reported single-cell activities in the
		  lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) that are correlated with
		  choice options and their subjective values. To investigate
		  the underlying synaptic mechanism, we considered a spiking
		  neuron model of decision making endowed with synaptic
		  plasticity that follows a reward-dependent stochastic
		  Hebbian learning rule. This general model is tested in a
		  matching task in which rewards on two targets are scheduled
		  randomly with different rates. Our main results are
		  threefold. First, we show that plastic synapses provide a
		  natural way to integrate past rewards and estimate the
		  local (in time) "return" of a choice. Second, our model
		  reproduces the matching behavior (i.e., the proportional
		  allocation of choices matches the relative reinforcement
		  obtained on those choices, which is achieved through
		  melioration in individual trials). Our model also explains
		  the observed "undermatching" phenomenon and points to
		  biophysical constraints (such as finite learning rate and
		  stochastic neuronal firing) that set the limits to matching
		  behavior. Third, although our decision model is an
		  attractor network exhibiting winner-take-all competition,
		  it captures graded neural spiking activities observed in
		  LIP, when the latter were sorted according to the choices
		  and the difference in the returns for the two targets.
		  These results suggest that neurons in LIP are involved in
		  selecting the oculomotor responses, whereas rewards are
		  integrated and stored elsewhere, possibly by plastic
		  synapses and in the form of the return rather than income
		  of choice options.}},

abstract	= {This book is an introduction to the design of asynchronous
		  circuits. It is an updated and significantly extended
		  version of an eight-chapter tutorial that first appeared as
		  Part I in the book {"}Principles of asynchronous circuit
		  design -- A systems perspective{"} edited by Spars{\o} and
		  Furber (2001); a book that has become a standard reference
		  on the topic. The extensions include improved coverage of
		  data-flow components, a new chapter on two-phase
		  bundled-data circuits, a new chapter on metastability,
		  arbitration, and synchronization, and a new chapter on
		  performance analysis using timed Petri nets. With these
		  extensions, the text now provides a more complete coverage
		  of the topic, and it is now made available as a stand-alone
		  book. The book is a beginner's text and the amount of
		  formal notation is deliberately kept at a minimum, using
		  instead plain English and graphical illustrations to
		  explain the underlying intuition and reasoning behind the
		  concepts and methods covered. The book targets senior
		  undergraduate and graduate students in Electrical and
		  Computer Engineering and industrial designers with a
		  background in conventional (clocked) digital design who
		  wish to gain an understanding of asynchronous circuit
		  design.},

abstract	= {The natural world presents us with a rich and
		  ever-changing sensory landscape containing diverse stimuli
		  that constantly compete for representation in the brain.
		  When the brain selects a stimulus as the highest priority
		  for attention, it differentially enhances the
		  representation of the selected, "target" stimulus and
		  suppresses the processing of other, distracting stimuli. A
		  stimulus may be selected for attention while it is still
		  present in the visual scene (predictive selection) or after
		  it has vanished (post hoc selection). We present a
		  biologically inspired computational model that accounts for
		  the prioritized processing of information about targets
		  that are selected for attention either predictively or post
		  hoc. Central to the model is the neurobiological mechanism
		  of "selective disinhibition" - the selective suppression of
		  inhibition of the representation of the target stimulus. We
		  demonstrate that this mechanism explains major
		  neurophysiological hallmarks of selective attention,
		  including multiplicative neural gain, increased inter-trial
		  reliability (decreased variability), and reduced noise
		  correlations. The same mechanism also reproduces key
		  behavioral hallmarks associated with target-distracter
		  interactions. Selective disinhibition exhibits several
		  distinguishing and advantageous features over alternative
		  mechanisms for implementing target selection, and is
		  capable of explaining the effects of selective attention
		  over a broad range of real-world conditions, involving both
		  predictive and post hoc biasing of sensory competition and
		  decisions.},

abstract	= {Recent research has uncovered a number of different ways
		  in which bees use cues derived from optic flow for
		  navigational purposes. The distance flown to a food source
		  is gauged by integrating the apparent motion of the visual
		  world that is experienced en route. In other words, bees
		  possess a visually driven 'odometer' that is robust to
		  variations in wind load and energy expenditure. Bees flying
		  through a tunnel maintain equidistance to the flanking
		  walls by balancing the apparent speeds of the images of the
		  walls. This strategy enables them to negotiate narrow
		  passages or to fly between obstacles. The speed of flight
		  in a tunnel is controlled by holding constant the average
		  image velocity as seen by the two eyes. This avoids
		  potential collisions by ensuring that the bee slows down
		  when flying through narrow passages. Bees landing on a
		  horizontal surface hold constant the image velocity of the
		  surface as they approach it. This automatically ensures
		  that flight speed decreases with altitude and is close to
		  zero at touchdown. The movement-sensitive mechanisms
		  underlying these various behaviours seem to be different,
		  qualitatively as well as quantitatively, from those
		  mediating the well-investigated optomotor response.},

abstract	= {Regularly spiking neurons can be described as oscillators.
		  In this article we review some of the insights gained from
		  this conceptualization and their relevance for systems
		  neuroscience. First, we explain how a regularly spiking
		  neuron can be viewed as an oscillator and how the
		  phase-response curve (PRC) describes the response of the
		  neuron's spike times to small perturbations. We then
		  discuss the meaning of the PRC for a single neuron's
		  spiking behavior and review the PRCs measured from a
		  variety of neurons in a range of spiking regimes. Next, we
		  show how the PRC can be related to a number of common
		  measures used to quantify neuronal firing, such as the
		  spike-triggered average and the peristimulus histogram. We
		  further show that the response of a neuron to correlated
		  inputs depends on the shape of the PRC. We then explain how
		  the PRC of single neurons can be used to predict neural
		  network behavior. Given the PRC, conduction delays, and the
		  waveform and time course of the synaptic potentials, it is
		  possible to predict neural population behavior such as
		  synchronization. The PRC also allows us to quantify the
		  robustness of the synchronization to heterogeneity and
		  noise. We finally ask how to combine the measured PRCs and
		  the predictions based on PRC to further the understanding
		  of systems neuroscience. As an example, we discuss how the
		  change of the PRC by the neuromodulator acetylcholine could
		  lead to a destabilization of cortical network dynamics.
		  Although all of these studies are grounded in mathematical
		  abstractions that do not strictly hold in biology, they
		  provide good estimates for the emergence of the brain's
		  network activity from the properties of individual neurons.
		  The study of neurons as oscillators can provide testable
		  hypotheses and mechanistic explanations for systems
		  neuroscience.}

		  obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks.
		  However, these accuracy improvements depend on the
		  availability of exceptionally large computational resources

		  As a result these models are costly to train and develop,
		  both financially, due to the cost of hardware and
		  electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due

		  Echo-state networks in which modification is restricted to
		  the weights of connections onto network outputs provide an
		  easier alternative, but at the expense of modifying the
		  typically sparse architecture of the network by including
		  feedback from the output back into the network. We derive
		  methods for using the values of the output weights from a
		  trained echo-state network to set recurrent weights within
		  the network. The result of this "transfer of learning" is a
		  recurrent network that performs the task without requiring
		  the output feedback present in the original network. We
		  also discuss a hybrid version in which online learning is
		  applied to both output and recurrent weights. Both
		  approaches provide efficient ways of training recurrent
		  networks to perform complex tasks. Through an analysis of
		  the conditions required to make transfer of learning work,
		  we define the concept of a "self-sensing" network state,
		  and we compare and contrast this with compressed sensing.

		  combining the signals from the receptive fields in the two
		  eyes. Local variations in single images can activate
		  neurons that do not signal the correct disparity (false
		  matches), giving rise to the stereo correspondence problem.
		  We used binocular white-noise stimuli to decompose the
		  responses of monkey primary visual cortex V1 neurons into
		  the elements of a linear-nonlinear model (via
		  spike-triggered covariance analysis). In our population of
		  disparity-selective neurons, we find both excitatory and
		  suppressive elements in many of the neurons. Their
		  binocular receptive fields were aligned in a specific
		  push-pull manner for disparity. We demonstrate that this
		  arrangement reduces the responses to false matches but
		  preserves the responses to true matches. The responses of
		  the cells to the noise stimuli were well explained by a
		  linear summation of the elements, followed by a
		  nonlinearity. This model also explained the shape of
		  independently measured disparity-tuning curves, although it
		  overestimated the response magnitude. This study
		  constitutes the first direct physiological evidence for the
		  contribution of suppressive mechanisms to disparity
		  selectivity. This new mechanism contributes to solving the
		  stereo correspondence problem.}

		  movements while observers viewed natural scenes, and

		  differences in the visual characteristics of fixated versus
		  non-fixated locations, these images were transformed to
		  make intensity, contrast, colour, and edge content
		  explicit. Signal detection and information theoretic
		  techniques were then used to compare fixated regions to
		  those that were not. The presence of contrast and edge
		  information was more strongly discriminatory than luminance
		  or chromaticity. Fixated locations tended to be more
		  distinctive in the high spatial frequencies. Extremes of
		  low frequency luminance information were avoided. With
		  prolonged viewing, consistency in fixation locations
		  between observers decreased. In contrast to [Parkhurst, D.
		  J., Law, K., \& Niebur, E. (2002). Modeling the role of
		  salience in the allocation of overt visual attention.
		  Vision Research, 42 (1), 107-123] we found no change in the
		  involvement of image features over time. We attribute this
		  difference in our results to a systematic bias in their
		  metric. We propose that saccade target selection involves
		  an unchanging intermediate level representation of the
		  scene but that the high-level interpretation of this
		  representation changes over time.}

abstract	= {Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to slower reaction times

		  diVerent, location as a preceding onset cue. The present
		  study examined IOR for expected (likely) and unexpected
		  (unlikely) targets under conditions in which stimulus'
		  response (S-R) expectancies were generated on a
		  trial-by-trial basis or maintained across a block of
		  trials. Three boxes were aligned along the vertical
		  midline. In Experiments 1 and 2, the appearance of a cue in
		  the upper or lower box was a signal to generate an
		  expectancy about the most likely color of an impending
		  discrimination target. In Experiment 3, one target color
		  was more likely than another across a block of trials. In
		  all cases, cue location did not predict target location.
		  When S-R expectancies were generated on a trial-by-trial
		  basis, IOR occurred for Unlikely targets but not for Likely
		  targets; this was true across a range of cue-target
		  stimulus onset asynchronies. In contrast, when S-R
		  expectancies were maintained over a block of trials, IOR
		  was larger for Likely than for Unlikely targets. These
		  Wndings reveal a critical interaction of S-R expectancies
		  with IOR. This interaction not only demonstrates the
		  modulation of IOR by cognitive expectancies, but in doing
		  so also provides evidence that is consistent with the view
		  that IOR reXects a conservative response bias.}

abstract	= {The processing speed of the brain depends on the ability
		  of neurons to rapidly relay input changes. Previous
		  theoretical and experimental studies of the timescale of
		  population firing rate responses arrived at controversial
		  conclusions, some advocating an ultrafast response scale
		  but others arguing for an inherent disadvantage of mean
		  encoded signals for rapid detection of the stimulus onset.
		  Here we assessed the timescale of population firing rate
		  responses of neocortical neurons in experiments performed
		  in the time domain and the frequency domain in vitro and in
		  vivo. We show that populations of neocortical neurons can
		  alter their firing rate within 1 ms in response to
		  somatically delivered weak current signals presented on a
		  fluctuating background. Signals with amplitudes of
		  miniature postsynaptic currents can be robustly and rapidly
		  detected in the population firing. We further show that
		  population firing rate of neurons of rat visual cortex in
		  vitro and cat visual cortex in vivo can reliably encode
		  weak signals varying at frequencies up to
		  \~{}200{\textendash}300 Hz, or \~{}50 times faster than the
		  firing rate of individual neurons. These results provide
		  coherent evidence for the ultrafast, millisecond timescale
		  of cortical population responses. Notably, fast responses
		  to weak stimuli are limited to the mean encoding. Rapid
		  detection of current variance changes requires
		  extraordinarily large signal amplitudes. Our study presents
		  conclusive evidence showing that cortical neurons are
		  capable of rapidly relaying subtle mean current signals.
		  This provides a vital mechanism for the propagation of
		  rate-coded information within and across brain areas.},

abstract	= {Models of attention and saccade target selection propose
		  that within the brain there is a topographic map of visual
		  salience that combines bottom-up and top-down influences to
		  identify locations for further processing. The results of a
		  series of experiments with monkeys performing visual search
		  tasks have identified a population of frontal eye field
		  (FEF) visually responsive neurons that exhibit all of the
		  characteristics of a visual salience map. The activity of
		  these FEF neurons is not sensitive to specific features of
		  visual stimuli; but instead, their activity evolves over
		  time to select the target of the search array. This
		  selective activation reflects both the bottom-up intrinsic
		  conspicuousness of the stimuli and the top-down knowledge
		  and goals of the viewer. The peak response within FEF
		  specifies the target for the overt gaze shift. However, the
		  selective activity in FEF is not in itself a motor command
		  because the magnitude of activation reflects the relative
		  behavioral significance of the different stimuli in the
		  visual scene and occurs even when no saccade is made.
		  Identifying a visual salience map in FEF validates the
		  theoretical concept of a salience map in many models of
		  attention. In addition, it strengthens the emerging view
		  that FEF is not only involved in producing overt gaze
		  shifts, but is also important for directing covert spatial
		  attention.}

abstract	= {Neural circuits consist of many noisy, slow components,
		  with individual neurons subject to ion channel noise,
		  axonal propagation delays, and unreliable and slow synaptic
		  transmission. This raises a fundamental question: how can
		  reliable computation emerge from such unreliable
		  components? A classic strategy is to simply average over a
		  population of N weakly-coupled neurons to achieve errors
		  that scale as 1 / N. But more interestingly, recent work
		  has introduced networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
		  neurons that achieve coding errors that scale
		  superclassically as 1/N by combining the principles of
		  predictive coding and fast and tight inhibitory-excitatory
		  balance. However, spike transmission delays preclude such
		  fast inhibition, and computational studies have observed
		  that such delays can cause pathological synchronization
		  that in turn destroys superclassical coding performance.
		  Intriguingly, it has also been observed in simulations that
		  noise can actually improve coding performance, and that
		  there exists some optimal level of noise that minimizes
		  coding error. However, we lack a quantitative theory that
		  describes this fascinating interplay between delays, noise
		  and neural coding performance in spiking networks. In this
		  work, we elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this
		  beneficial role of noise by deriving analytical expressions
		  for coding error as a function of spike propagation delay
		  and noise levels in predictive coding tight-balance
		  networks of LIF neurons. Furthermore, we compute the
		  minimal coding error and the associated optimal noise
		  level, finding that they grow as power-laws with the delay.
		  Our analysis reveals quantitatively how optimal levels of
		  noise can rescue neural coding performance in spiking
		  neural networks with delays by preventing the build up of
		  pathological synchrony without overwhelming the overall
		  spiking dynamics. This analysis can serve as a foundation
		  for the further study of precise computation in the
		  presence of noise and delays in efficient spiking neural
		  circuits.}

		  organism's neural activity to behavior. Neural population
		  analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on
		  relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis
		  is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number
		  of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether
		  spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population
		  dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we
		  can accurately estimate the geometry of low-dimensional
		  manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the
		  data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor
		  cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three
		  previous studies and found that neural dynamics and
		  scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit
		  threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons. This
		  finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs
		  the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory
		  and clinical use. Trautmann et al. ask whether spike
		  sorting is necessary for investigation at the level of
		  neural populations. They show that combining multiple
		  neurons on each electrode introduces only minor distortions
		  in estimates of neural population state.},

		  memristors which are based on filamentary-switching
		  mechanism can be found more popularly and are easy to be
		  fabricated than analog memristors that are rare in
		  materials and need a more complicated fabrication process.
		  Thus, we develop a neuromorphic crossbar circuit using
		  filamentary-switching binary memristors not using
		  interface-switching analog memristors. The proposed binary
		  memristor crossbar can recognize five vowels with 4-bit 64
		  input channels. The proposed crossbar is tested by 2,500
		  speech samples and verified to be able to recognize
		  89.2{\%} of the tested samples. From the statistical
		  simulation, the recognition rate of the binary memristor
		  crossbar is estimated to be degraded very little from
		  89.2{\%} to 80{\%}, though the percentage variation in
		  memristance is increased very much from 0{\%} to 15{\%}. In
		  contrast, the analog memristor crossbar loses its
		  recognition rate significantly from 96{\%} to 9{\%} for the
		  same percentage variation in memristance.}

		  Recent research on artificial neural networks trained by

		  Here we propose a simple neural network framework that

		  how neuropsychological impairments observed in patients
		  with prefrontal damage are mimicked by lesions of our

		  handle the abundance of schemas necessary to navigate the

abstract	= {Circuits composed of threshold gates (McCulloch-Pitts
		  neurons, or perceptrons) are simplified models of neural
		  circuits with the advantage that they are theoretically
		  more tractable than their biological counterparts. However,
		  when such threshold circuits are designed to perform a
		  specific computational task, they usually differ in one
		  important respect from computations in the brain: they
		  require very high activity. On average every second
		  threshold gate fires (sets a 1 as output) during a
		  computation. By contrast, the activity of neurons in the
		  brain is much sparser, with only about 1\% of neurons
		  firing. This mismatch between threshold and neuronal
		  circuits is due to the particular complexity measures
		  (circuit size and circuit depth) that have been minimized
		  in previous threshold circuit constructions. In this
		  letter, we investigate a new complexity measure for
		  threshold circuits, energy complexity, whose minimization
		  yields computations with sparse activity. We prove that all
		  computations by threshold circuits of polynomial size with
		  entropy O(log n) can be restructured so that their energy
		  complexity is reduced to a level near the entropy of
		  circuit states. This entropy of circuit states is a novel
		  circuit complexity measure, which is of interest not only
		  in the context of threshold circuits but for circuit
		  complexity in general. As an example of how this measure
		  can be applied, we show that any polynomial size threshold
		  circuit with entropy O(log n) can be simulated by a
		  polynomial size threshold circuit of depth 3. Our results
		  demonstrate that the structure of circuits that result from
		  a minimization of their energy complexity is quite
		  different from the structure that results from a
		  minimization of previously considered complexity measures,
		  and potentially closer to the structure of neural circuits
		  in the nervous system. In particular, different pathways
		  are activated in these circuits for different classes of
		  inputs. This letter shows that such circuits with sparse
		  activity have a surprisingly large computational power.},

abstract	= {The amount of visual information projected from the retina
		  to the brain exceeds the information processing capacity of
		  the latter. Attention, therefore, functions as a filter to
		  highlight important information at multiple stages of the
		  visual pathway that requires further and more detailed
		  analysis. Among other functions, this determines where to
		  fixate since only the fovea allows for high resolution
		  imaging. Visual saliency modeling, i.e. understanding how
		  the brain selects important information to analyze further
		  and to determine where to fixate next, is an important
		  research topic in computational neuroscience and computer
		  vision. Most existing bottom-up saliency models use
		  low-level features such as intensity and color, while some
		  models employ high-level features, like faces. However,
		  little consideration has been given to mid-level features,
		  such as texture, for visual saliency models. In this paper,
		  we extend a biologically plausible proto-object based
		  saliency model by adding simple texture channels which
		  employ nonlinear operations that mimic the processing
		  performed by primate visual cortex. The extended model
		  shows statistically significant improved performance in
		  predicting human fixations compared to the previous model.
		  Comparing the performance of our model with others on
		  publicly available benchmarking datasets, we find that our
		  biologically plausible model matches the performance of
		  other models, even though those were designed entirely for
		  maximal performance with little regard to biological
		  realism.}

abstract	= {Neuromorphic computing could address the inherent
		  limitations of conventional silicon technology in dedicated
		  machine learning applications. Recent work on silicon-based
		  asynchronous spiking neural networks and large crossbar
		  arrays of two-terminal memristive devices has led to the
		  development of promising neuromorphic systems. However,
		  delivering a compact and efficient parallel computing
		  technology that is capable of embedding artificial neural
		  networks in hardware remains a significant challenge.
		  Organic electronic materials offer an attractive option for
		  such systems and could provide biocompatible and relatively
		  inexpensive neuromorphic devices with low-energy switching
		  and excellent tunability. Here, we review the development
		  of organic neuromorphic devices. We consider different
		  resistance-switching mechanisms, which typically rely on
		  electrochemical doping or charge trapping, and report
		  approaches that enhance state retention and conductance
		  tuning. We also discuss the challenges the field faces in
		  implementing low-power neuromorphic computing, such as
		  device downscaling and improving device speed. Finally, we
		  highlight early demonstrations of device integration into
		  arrays, and consider future directions and potential
		  applications of this technology.},

abstract	= {Musicians can perform at different tempos, speakers can
		  control the cadence of their speech, and children can
		  flexibly vary their temporal expectations of events. To
		  understand the neural basis of such flexibility, we
		  recorded from the medial frontal cortex of nonhuman
		  primates trained to produce different time intervals with
		  different effectors. Neural responses were heterogeneous,
		  nonlinear, and complex, and they exhibited a remarkable
		  form of temporal invariance: firing rate profiles were
		  temporally scaled to match the produced intervals.
		  Recording from downstream neurons in the caudate and from
		  thalamic neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex
		  indicated that this phenomenon originates within cortical
		  networks. Recurrent neural network models trained to
		  perform the task revealed that temporal scaling emerges
		  from nonlinearities in the network and that the degree of
		  scaling is controlled by the strength of external input.
		  These findings demonstrate a simple and general mechanism
		  for conferring temporal flexibility upon sensorimotor and
		  cognitive functions.},

		  timescales, while learned behaviors can require many days
		  to mature. While recent experimental advances enable
		  large-scale and long-term neural recordings with high
		  temporal fidelity, it remains a formidable challenge to
		  extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how
		  rapid single-trial circuit dynamics change slowly over many
		  trials to mediate learning. We demonstrate a simple tensor
		  component analysis (TCA) can meet this challenge by
		  extracting three interconnected, low-dimensional
		  descriptions of neural data: neuron factors, reflecting
		  cell assemblies; temporal factors, reflecting rapid circuit
		  dynamics mediating perceptions, thoughts, and actions
		  within each trial; and trial factors, describing both
		  long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive
		  state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by
		  revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from
		  artificial neural networks, large-scale calcium imaging of
		  rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation, and
		  multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during
		  brain machine interface learning. Williams et al. describe
		  an unsupervised method to uncover simple structure in
		  large-scale recordings by extracting distinct cell
		  assemblies with rapid within-trial dynamics, reflecting
		  interpretable aspects of perceptions, actions, and
		  thoughts, and slower across-trial dynamics reflecting
		  learning and internal state changes.},

abstract	= {The recent commercialization of electronic memories based
		  on phase change materials proved the usability of this
		  peculiar family of materials for application purposes. More
		  advanced data storage and computing concepts, however,
		  demand a deeper understanding especially of the electrical
		  properties of the amorphous phase and the switching
		  behaviour. In this work, we investigate the temporal
		  evolution of the current through the amorphous state of the
		  prototypical phase change material, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 , under
		  constant voltage. A custom-made electrical tester allows
		  the measurement of delay times over five orders of
		  magnitude, as well as the transient states of electrical
		  excitation prior to the actual threshold switching. We
		  recognize a continuous current increase over time prior to
		  the actual threshold-switching event to be a good measure
		  for the electrical excitation. A clear correlation between
		  a significant rise in pre-switching-current and the later
		  occurrence of threshold switching can be observed. This
		  way, we found experimental evidence for the existence of an
		  absolute minimum for the threshold voltage (or electric
		  field respectively) holding also for time scales far beyond
		  the measurement range.}

		  replicating its hallmark functional capabilities in terms
		  of computational power, robust learning and energy
		  efficiency. We employ a single-chip prototype of the
		  BrainScaleS 2 neuromorphic system to implement a
		  proof-of-concept demonstration of reward-modulated
		  spike-timing-dependent plasticity in a spiking network that
		  learns to play a simplified version of the Pong video game
		  by smooth pursuit. This system combines an electronic
		  mixed-signal substrate for emulating neuron and synapse
		  dynamics with an embedded digital processor for on-chip
		  learning, which in this work also serves to simulate the
		  virtual environment and learning agent. The analog
		  emulation of neuronal membrane dynamics enables a 1000-fold
		  acceleration with respect to biological real-time, with the
		  entire chip operating on a power budget of 57 mW. Compared
		  to an equivalent simulation using state-of-the-art
		  software, the on-chip emulation is at least one order of
		  magnitude faster and three orders of magnitude more
		  energy-efficient. We demonstrate how on-chip learning can
		  mitigate the effects of fixed-pattern noise, which is
		  unavoidable in analog substrates, while making use of
		  temporal variability for action exploration. Learning
		  compensates imperfections of the physical substrate, as
		  manifested in neuronal parameter variability, by adapting
		  synaptic weights to match respective excitability of
		  individual neurons.}

		  performing rule-dependent tasks and working memory-based
		  decision making. Motivated by experimental data, we develop
		  an excitatory-inhibitory spiking recurrent neural network
		  (SRNN) to perform a rule-dependent two-alternative forced
		  choice (2AFC) task. We imposed several important biological
		  constraints onto the SRNN, and adapted the spike frequency
		  adaptation (SFA) and SuperSpike gradient methods to update
		  the network parameters. These proposed strategies enabled
		  us to train the SRNN efficiently and overcome the vanishing
		  gradient problem during error back propagation through
		  time. The trained SRNN produced rule-specific tuning in
		  single-unit representations, showing rule-dependent
		  population dynamics that strongly resemble experimentally
		  observed data in rodent and monkey. Under varying test
		  conditions, we further manipulated the parameters or
		  configuration in computer simulation setups and
		  investigated the impacts of rule-coding error, delay
		  duration, weight connectivity and sparsity, and
		  excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance on both task
		  performance and neural representations. Overall, our
		  modeling study provides a computational framework to
		  understand neuronal representations at a fine timescale
		  during working memory and cognitive control. Author Summary
		  Working memory and decision making are fundamental
		  cognitive functions of the brain, but the circuit
		  mechanisms of these brain functions remain incompletely
		  understood. Neuroscientists have trained animals (rodents
		  or monkeys) to perform various cognitive tasks while
		  simultaneously recording the neural activity from specific
		  neural circuits. To complement the experimental
		  investigations, computational modeling may provide an
		  alternative way to examine the neural representations of
		  neuronal assemblies during task behaviors. Here we develop
		  and train a spiking recurrent neural network (SRNN)
		  consisting of balanced excitatory and inhibitory neurons to
		  perform the rule-dependent working memory tasks Our
		  computer simulations produce qualitatively similar results
		  as the experimental findings. Moreover, the imposed

abstract	= {Frequency modulation (FM) is a prominent feature in animal
		  vocalization and human speech. Although many neurons in the
		  auditory cortex are known to be selective for FM direction,
		  the synaptic mechanisms underlying this selectivity are not
		  well understood. Previous studies of both visual and
		  auditory neurons have suggested two general mechanisms for
		  direction selectivity: (1) differential delays of
		  excitatory inputs across the spatial/spectral receptive
		  field and (2) spatial/spectral offset between excitatory
		  and inhibitory inputs. In this study, we have examined the
		  contributions of both mechanisms to FM direction
		  selectivity in rat primary auditory cortex. The excitatory
		  and inhibitory synaptic inputs to each cortical neuron were
		  measured by in vivo whole-cell recording. The
		  spectrotemporal receptive field of each type of inputs was
		  mapped with random tone pips and compared with direction
		  selectivity of the neuron measured with FM stimuli. We
		  found that both the differential delay of the excitatory
		  input and the spectral offset between excitation and
		  inhibition are positively correlated with direction
		  selectivity of the neuron. Thus, both synaptic mechanisms
		  are likely to contribute to FM direction selectivity in the
		  auditory cortex. Finally, direction selectivity measured
		  from the spiking output is significantly stronger than that
		  based on the subthreshold membrane potentials, indicating
		  that the selectivity is further sharpened by the spike
		  generation mechanism.},

abstract	= {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are bio-inspired models
		  of neural computation that have proven highly effective.
		  Still, ANNs lack a natural notion of time, and neural units
		  in ANNs exchange analog values in a frame-based manner, a
		  computationally and energetically inefficient form of
		  communication. This contrasts sharply with biological
		  neurons that communicate sparingly and efficiently using
		  isomorphic binary spikes. While Spiking Neural Networks
		  (SNNs) can be constructed by replacing the units of an ANN
		  with spiking neurons (Cao et al., 2015; Diehl et al., 2015)
		  to obtain reasonable performance, these SNNs use Poisson
		  spiking mechanisms with exceedingly high firing rates
		  compared to their biological counterparts. Here we show how
		  spiking neurons that employ a form of neural coding can be
		  used to construct SNNs that match high-performance ANNs and
		  match or exceed state-of-the-art in SNNs on important
		  benchmarks, while requiring firing rates compatible with
		  biological findings. For this, we use spike-based coding
		  based on the firing rate limiting adaptation phenomenon
		  observed in biological spiking neurons. This phenomenon can
		  be captured in fast adapting spiking neuron models, for
		  which we derive the effective transfer function. Neural
		  units in ANNs trained with this transfer function can be
		  substituted directly with adaptive spiking neurons, and the
		  resulting Adaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) can carry out competitive
		  classification in deep neural networks without further
		  modifications. Adaptive spike-based coding additionally
		  allows for the dynamic control of neural coding precision:
		  we show empirically how a simple model of arousal in AdSNNs
		  further halves the average required firing rate and this
		  notion naturally extends to other forms of attention as
		  studied in neuroscience. AdSNNs thus hold promise as a
		  novel and sparsely active model for neural computation that
		  naturally fits to temporally continuous and asynchronous
		  applications.}

abstract	= {Cortical networks show a large heterogeneity of neuronal
		  properties. However, traditional coding models have focused
		  on homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory
		  neurons. Here, we analytically derive a class of recurrent
		  networks of spiking neurons that close to optimally track a
		  continuously varying input online, based on two
		  assumptions: 1) every spike is decoded linearly and 2) the
		  network aims to reduce the mean-squared error between the
		  input and the estimate. From this we derive a class of
		  predictive coding networks, that unifies encoding and
		  decoding and in which we can investigate the difference
		  between homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks, in
		  which each neurons represents different features and has
		  different spike-generating properties. We find that in this
		  framework, type 1' and type 2' neurons arise naturally and
		  networks consisting of a heterogeneous population of
		  different neuron types are both more efficient and more
		  robust against correlated noise. We make two experimental
		  predictions: 1) we predict that integrators show strong
		  correlations with other integrators and resonators are
		  correlated with resonators, whereas the correlations are
		  much weaker between neurons with different coding
		  properties and 2) that type 2' neurons are more coherent
		  with the overall network activity than type 1' neurons.},

abstract	= {Neuromorphic processing systems implementing spiking
		  neural networks with mixed signal analog/digital electronic
		  circuits and/or memristive devices represent a promising
		  technology for edge computing applications that require low
		  power, low latency, and that cannot connect to the cloud
		  for off-line processing, either due to lack of connectivity
		  or for privacy concerns. However these circuits are
		  typically noisy and imprecise, because they are affected by
		  device to device variability, and operate with extremely
		  small currents. So achieving reliable computation and high
		  accuracy following this approach is still an open challenge
		  that has hampered progress on one hand and limited
		  widespread adoption of this technology on the other. By
		  construction, these hardware processing systems have many
		  constraints that are biologically plausible, such as
		  heterogeneity and non-negativity of parameters. More and
		  more evidence is showing that applying such constraints to
		  artificial neural networks, including those used in
		  artificial intelligence, promotes robustness in learning
		  and improves their reliability. Here we delve even more in
		  neuroscience and present network-level brain-inspired
		  strategies that further improve reliability and robustness
		  in these neuromorphic systems: we quantify, with chip
		  measurements, to what extent population averaging is
		  effective in reducing variability in neural responses, we
		  demonstrate experimentally how the neural coding strategies
		  of cortical models allow silicon neurons to produce
		  reliable signal representations, and show how to robustly
		  implement essential computational primitives, such as
		  selective amplification, signal restoration, working
		  memory, and relational networks, exploiting such
		  strategies. We argue that these strategies can be
		  instrumental for guiding the design of robust and reliable
		  ultra-low power electronic neural processing systems
		  implemented using noisy and imprecise computing substrates
		  such as subthreshold neuromorphic circuits and emerging
		  memory technologies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
